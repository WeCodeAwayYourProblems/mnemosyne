He had timed the end of the world perfectly this time.

Far below his balcony, people were already screaming. The sky had dimmed without warning, the floating spires guttering out one by one as though pinched between invisible fingers. Bridges of light collapsed. Carriages suspended in air dropped soundlessly before sound remembered how to travel. In the avenues beneath him, robed figures ran, their spells flaring uselessly against a dark that did not resist—it simply consumed. He did not move. He stood at the center of his observatory, faceless beneath the hood of bone-white metal, long fingers resting lightly on an instrument whose rings spun with patient inevitability. The air trembled as the world forgot how to hold itself together.

The horizon split without thunder. Light returned—not from the heavens, but from beneath the foundations of the earth. It rose through stone and sea alike, a white so complete it devoured shadow and contour. Oceans withdrew as if inhaled by something vast and unseen. Mountains bent like wax near a flame. Cities folded inward, towers creasing, streets collapsing into bright seams. The screaming thinned, stretched, then vanished. He remained, a still axis in a dissolving sphere, watching the white climb the walls of his chamber and swallow the instruments one by one.

He did not resist it.

When the white reached him, it did not burn. It unwrote. Metal, marrow, memory—each reduced to outline, then filament, then absence. For a moment that might have been a heartbeat or an era, there was only brightness. Then even that was gone.

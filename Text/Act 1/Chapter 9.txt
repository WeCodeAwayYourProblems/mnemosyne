The guild master did not raise his voice.

That was how Matthis knew he was afraid.

“You don’t take assets without clearance,” Master Corven said, fingers steepled on the desk as if holding them together kept the world from slipping. “You don’t drag undead into the woods like a storybook fool. And you certainly don’t involve mine wizards without permission.”

Matthis stood straight, hands loose at his sides.

“The undead is gone,” he said.

Corven’s mouth twitched. “Gone?”

“Reduced to ash. Completely. Nothing stirred afterward.”

Silence pressed down on the office. The walls smelled faintly of pitch and old smoke, the lingering perfume of a profession built on fear management rather than solutions.

Corven leaned back. His chair creaked. “You expect me to believe you’ve found a way to end what’s plagued this town for three years… on a whim?”

Matthis met his gaze. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t rush.

“I expect you to send men to the pit in the woods,” he said calmly. “Check the site. Dig through the ash if you like. There’s nothing left to rise.”

Corven studied him as if waiting for the cages outside to start rattling in response.

“They react to you,” Corven said quietly. “You walk past and bones stir. Men notice these things. It’s unsettling.”

“I didn’t make them,” Matthis replied. “But I can help end them.”

Another long pause.

Corven exhaled through his nose. “If you’re lying—”

“Then I’ll submit to whatever punishment you see fit.”

That, finally, shifted something.

Corven nodded once. “We’ll see.”

They did.

By evening, word had spread. Not shouted. Murmured. The kind of rumor that crept instead of ran. Ash pits. Clean burns. Nothing crawling back.

The Death Guild didn’t announce a policy change.

They didn’t have to.

The next day, chains were ordered. Firewood stockpiled. A pair of men were reassigned—not to cages, but to *fires*.

Ash had consequences.

Matthis felt them ripple outward even as he tried not to.

That afternoon, he stopped by the bakery.

The smell hit him first—warm bread, sugar, something floral beneath it all. Comfort, baked into the air like a spell you didn’t notice until it was gone.

Elspeth stood behind the counter, laughing softly as she handed a loaf to an old woman. Her smile wasn’t wide or performative. It was the kind that lingered, as if she didn’t know how to stop caring once she started.

Matthis watched her hands.

She moved differently today. Not hurried. Intentional. As she dusted the loaves, she pinched something between her fingers—too fine to be flour, too deliberate to be habit—and let it fall with a small, unconscious gesture.

The air… shifted.

Not sharply. Gently. Like a room settling after a door closes.

Matthis’s stomach tightened.

That night, he opened the book.

“She’s a witch,” he said flatly. “Isn’t she.”

The pages turned slowly.

**Yes.**

His jaw clenched. “Did this”—he gestured at himself—“do that to her?”

**No.**

The answer came without hesitation.

**Many humans are born with an uneven flow. Wizards train it. Witches shape it instinctively. Hers leaks into objects. Food. Cloth. Small kindnesses magnified.**

“Is she dangerous?”

A pause—not theatrical, but measured.

**Talent is not monstrosity. She has not changed. You have simply learned how to see.**

Matthis shut the book and sat in the dark for a long time.

The next morning, he returned to the bakery.

Elspeth looked up and smiled, just as she always had. No guarded curiosity. No awe. Just recognition.

“You’re early,” she said.

“Couldn’t sleep,” he admitted.

She slid a small roll across the counter. “On the house. You look like you need something warm.”

He hesitated, then took it.

“It’s good,” he said after a bite. And it was. Comforting in a way that felt… deliberate.

She tilted her head. “You noticed.”

“Yes.”

They stood there, the space between them easy.

“You know,” he said carefully, “this town grinds people down. Most folks forget how to be kind. You haven’t.”

Elspeth blinked, surprised. Then she smiled—not bright, not shy. Real.

“Someone has to remind it how,” she said.

Matthis nodded.

As he left, warmth followed him into the street—not magic exactly, not control.

Just the sense that things *could* be better.

And that, he realized, was far more dangerous than fear.

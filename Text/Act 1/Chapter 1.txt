The mine breathed when no one was watching.

Matthis paused at the mouth of the lower shaft and listened, lamp held low, wick trimmed to a thin, disciplined flame. The air moved past him in slow pulses, cool against his cheeks, as if the mountain were sleeping badly. He waited for the sound that would send him back—stone shifting, timber groaning—but the dark stayed quiet. Patient.

He stepped in anyway.

The ladder down had lost two rungs since last week. He noted it without surprise. Everything down here wore itself away. Wood softened, iron bloomed with rust, men thinned at the edges. The mine took its due slowly, the way old things did.

His boots touched the floor, and the sound went nowhere. The dark swallowed it whole.

Matthis angled the lamp forward. The tunnel narrowed ahead, stone walls slick with old moisture, veins of dull metal threading through like scars that never healed right. This wasn’t an official passage. No chalk marks. No prayer scratches. No safety posts. He wasn’t supposed to be here.

That was why he was.

He moved carefully, counting his steps without meaning to. Twenty-seven from the ladder to the bend. Another twelve to the fault line where the rock pinched inward. He’d learned to measure spaces with his body—how far he could reach, how long he could hold his breath, how much weight he could bear before something in him started to shake. The mine taught you that, whether you wanted to learn or not.

The wizard had been here.

Matthis didn’t know how he knew that, only that the air felt worked-over. Like a room after a long argument—nothing broken, but nothing settled either. The wizard’s blasts always left a smell, sharp and mineral, like lightning trapped in stone. This tunnel held the faint ghost of it.

He swallowed and went on.

A memory surfaced uninvited: the wizard laughing, soot-blackened and pleased with himself, holding up a stone that glimmered faintly even in daylight.

*Found it where the vein breaks,* he’d said. *Like the mountain was bleeding.*

The stone had warmed in his palm as he spoke. Not heat—something steadier. A fullness. The wizard had gone quiet after that, eyes unfocused, as if listening to a voice no one else could hear.

The next day, he’d blasted through twice the rock with half the effort and collapsed laughing in the dust, trembling like a man pulled back from deep water.

Matthis had watched. He always watched.

He rounded the bend and stopped.

The wall ahead wasn’t stone.

It looked like stone. It felt like stone when he pressed his fingers to it. Cold, unyielding. But the lamp-light slid across it wrong, catching on angles that didn’t match the rest of the tunnel. Too smooth in places. Too deliberate.

Someone had sealed this.

Not recently. The edges had softened, the join lines blurred by time. But the intent lingered. This wasn’t a cave-in or a natural fold. This was a door that had forgotten how to open.

His pulse ticked louder in his ears. He told himself he could turn back. That he’d already gone far enough. That curiosity was a bad reason to die.

He didn’t move.

There was something else here. A pressure, barely there, like the moment before a headache. He shifted his weight, and it shifted with him. Not sound. Not heat. Attention.

“Alright,” he murmured, surprised at the steadiness of his own voice. “I see you.”

The stone didn’t answer. But the pressure eased, just a fraction, and he felt—absurdly—as if something had leaned closer.

He raised the lamp higher.

At the base of the wall, half-buried in dust and gravel, lay a shard of something darker than the surrounding rock. Not ore. Not slag. Too clean. Its surface caught the light and held it, swallowing the flame’s reflection without shining back.

Matthis crouched.

Up close, the shard was smooth and faceted, like it had been broken from a larger whole along lines that knew where to go. Symbols ghosted beneath its surface—no, not symbols. The suggestion of them. As if the stone remembered being written on.

His mouth went dry.

This was why he’d come back alone. Not because he wanted power, or answers, or to prove anything to the wizard. Because the mine had started to feel *incomplete* to him, like a sentence cut off mid-thought. Because sometimes, late at night, he dreamed of doors that didn’t open until you stopped trying to force them.

He reached out.

The shard was warm.

Not like the wizard’s stone. This warmth wasn’t fullness—it was invitation. A hand held out in the dark, palm up, waiting to see if you’d take it.

He hesitated.

A different memory rose, unbidden: his mother’s voice, sharp with fear the day he’d told her he was taking work underground.

*Stone doesn’t care who you are,* she’d said. *It doesn’t notice when you stop breathing.*

He closed his fingers around the shard.

The pressure snapped tight.

For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then the mine inhaled.

The lamp went out.

Darkness slammed into him from all sides, thick and absolute, and Matthis cried out as the floor fell away. Not down—*elsewhere*. His stomach lurched, his ears filled with a roaring like wind through a thousand tunnels, and the shard burned in his hand, cold and hot at once.

He squeezed his eyes shut.

When he opened them, the dark was different.

Not the close, pressing dark of the mine, but a vast, vaulted absence. The air was dry, unmoving. The floor beneath him was smooth stone etched with lines that caught the faint ambient glow leaking from nowhere in particular.

He was no longer alone.

Tables ringed the chamber, heavy and deliberate, their surfaces crowded with objects that made no sense together: bones etched with sigils, glass vessels clouded with residue, metal frames holding fragments of something that pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat slowed almost to stopping. Chains hung from the ceiling, some ending in nothing at all.

At the far end of the room stood a lectern.

Upon it rested a book.

Matthis pushed himself to his feet, heart hammering, the shard crumbling to dust in his hand. The dust didn’t fall. It drifted upward, drawn toward the book, and vanished into its pages.

The book lay closed. Its cover was plain, unadorned, the leather worn smooth by hands that had not existed for a very long time.

The air shifted.

Not a voice. Not a presence. But the unmistakable sense of something *noticing* him.

Matthis took one careful step forward.

The book did not open.

But for the first time since he’d entered the mine, he felt certain of one thing:

Whatever had built this place had been waiting.

And somehow—impossibly—it had known his name.

The lanterns along the cobblestone street were guttered and tired, flickering like the breath of a dying thing. Smoke from the bakeries and the smithies mingled with the damp fog that rolled in from the river. Matthis tightened his coat against the chill, the leather creaking under his arms as he climbed the narrow steps to the guildhouse.

It smelled of dust, ash, and old stone—the kind of smell that clung to a place for decades. He paused at the door, fingers brushing the carved crest of the Guild of Custodians. A hand reached over his shoulder and rapped sharply.

“Late again, boy?”

Matthis turned. It was Orven, a man built like a blacksmith, with a beard as coarse as rope and eyes that had seen too many bodies. “I—I had to finish the haul from the eastern mine,” Matthis said, voice low.

Orven grunted. “You’d better not make a habit of it. Today’s recovery isn’t one to mess around with.”

Matthis swallowed. He knew the meaning: the body they were recovering today was fresh. Too fresh. The mage had died yesterday, in the western cavern, and already the whispers said magic clung to the corpse like a stain.

Inside, the guildhouse smelled of incense, vinegar, and iron. Apprentices hurried along the stone floors with lanterns, carrying bundles of shrouds and iron chains. Maps and ledgers hung on the walls, some faded almost to nothing.

A hush fell when Matthis stepped into the main hall. Guildmasters and veteran custodians looked up from their tables, eyes sharp beneath furrowed brows.

“Matthis,” one of the elders said, voice brittle, “you know the rules. Wizard corpses are not to be touched without preparation. The wards are unstable. One mistake…”

He didn’t need to finish the sentence. They all knew. One mistake, and the dead could rise. Liches, wights, low-tier vampires—things no ordinary man could face.

Matthis nodded and followed Orven into the preparation room, where the body had been laid out. The room was lined with iron talismans, protective sigils etched into the walls and floor. Candles burned in precise patterns, smoke curling toward the vaulted ceiling.

The corpse lay on a cold slab, a wizard whose life had been cut short by a misfired spell. Even now, faint blue sparks danced along his hands and eyes, dying pulses of magical energy that could flare into life if disturbed. Matthis felt a shiver run down his spine.

“Handle him gently,” Orven said, handing him a leather strap. “The wards are delicate. One wrong move and you’ll wake more than dust.”

Matthis nodded again. He bent to secure the chains, feeling the residual hum of magic brush against his skin. His hands were steady, though his heart thudded in his chest. He had done this before—hundreds of times—but it never got easier. Every corpse carried the echo of life, the lingering potential to erupt.

The work was methodical: bind, chant, seal. Each motion precise, each word measured. The wards responded to intent and fear alike, and Matthis had learned that hesitation could be fatal. He moved through the motions, counting his breaths, feeling the hum of the wizard’s energy slowly dissipate.

Finally, Orven stepped back, inspecting the seals. “Good. Not perfect, but it’ll hold until the guild can dispose of him. Take it slow next time.”

Matthis exhaled, muscles taut, mind racing. Outside, the fog thickened, curling around the guildhouse like a living thing. He glanced down at the lantern, the light flickering over the iron chains and the still, silent body.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, a thought whispered: *There are others like him. Others you’ve never seen.*

He shook it off and followed Orven out into the night. The streets were empty now, except for the occasional wisp of smoke and the distant clang of a blacksmith’s hammer. In the quiet, he could still feel the hum—the residue of magic clinging to the air, to the stone, to himself.

Tonight, he had survived. Tomorrow, the guild would send another team. Another corpse. Another pulse of dangerous power. And he would be there, hands steady, heart racing, living on the edge between the living and the dead.

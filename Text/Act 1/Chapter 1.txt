The sun had barely risen over the jagged peaks of the mining town, but the air was already thick with smoke and dust. The Guild of Custodians was set at the edge of the settlement, a squat stone building that reeked of iron and old stone, flanked by rows of open-air cages. Inside, the bones of undead rattled slowly in the breeze, their occasional moans like the wind carrying the voices of the dead. Some cages had barely recognizable skeletons, others hunched, twisted forms with shards of faded robes still clinging to them.
Matthis clutched the leather straps at his belt and walked among the cages, the clatter of bones and distant moaning making him shiver. He was an attendant, not a wizard—just enough to work with chains and bind the corpses for transport. He was careful to keep his distance, eyes flicking to the guildmasters moving with precision, their hands tracing wards in the air, glowing faintly as they manipulated the magical residues clinging to the dead.
A scream echoed from the nearby mine, a short, sharp cry of panic. Matthis froze, his stomach knotting. He had heard them—miners sometimes didn’t make it back, their magic lingering after death, feeding the undead or worse.
Inside the guildhouse, candles burned in tall iron holders, smoke curling toward the vaulted ceiling. Matthis stepped carefully along the stone floor, chains rattling softly. A small group of wizards was preparing the latest haul: three miners who had died in a collapse the day before, their magic still sparking faintly along broken robes and singed sleeves.
“Steady, boy,” one of the wizards said without looking up. He was older, gray-haired, eyes sharp as flint. “Keep the chains tight. Don’t let the wards slip.”
Matthis nodded, hands gripping the cold iron as he helped secure the bindings. His fingers brushed over the last weak pulses of magical energy, a tremor in his palms that made his blood run cold. He had learned enough to know that a single mistake could awaken them—liches, wights, or worse, vampires of low-tier who clung to the world with hunger.
Through the open doorway, the wind carried the faint sound of the mine: scraping metal, distant calls, the murmur of restless spirits. Outside, a cage shuddered violently as one skeleton leaned against the bars, rattling them in a slow, eerie rhythm. Matthis forced his eyes away.
“Quiet your fear,” another wizard said, reading his expression. “Fear feeds them more than any spell. Move, now.”
He followed instructions, adjusting the chains, bowing his head when the first body was lifted onto the transport cart. The cadavers were miners, men he had seen trudging through the tunnels only days before, now nothing more than skin, bone, and the faint residue of magic. The wards hissed and flickered as the bodies were secured, a thin blue light tracing the lines of their veins even in death.
A sudden rattle from one of the cages made him jump. A skeleton leaned forward, jaw working as if to speak, but no words came. A moan followed, a low, lingering note that set his teeth on edge. He gritted them and focused on the chains.
By the time the last body was secured, Matthis’ hands were raw, his knuckles white. The wizards stepped back, inspecting their work, murmuring incantations to seal the wards. The air shimmered faintly as the energy settled. Outside, the wind tugged at the cages, and he could hear the skeletons rattling, moaning, twisting in their metal prisons.
“Good,” the elder said at last. “Take the rest of the day to yourself. You’ll need it before the next haul.”
Matthis exhaled, relief washing over him. He stepped outside, lantern swinging, and stopped at the edge of the yard. The cages loomed above him, the bones clattering like distant rain. He shivered, gripping the leather straps at his belt. Magic had taken these men from life—and left only echoes of it behind.
And yet, somewhere in the edges of his mind, curiosity bloomed. How did the energy linger so stubbornly? How did the wizards control it so easily while the dead moaned in chains just beyond reach?
He didn’t notice the faint shimmer of a blue spark along the edge of one cage, moving like a whisper. It was already beginning, a hint of the world he had not yet seen, waiting for him beyond the Guild, beyond the mines, beyond the dead.

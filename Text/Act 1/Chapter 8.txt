The town never quite slept.

Even at dawn, when the mine bells were quiet and the taverns had shuttered their windows, there was movement—boots on gravel, a muttered curse, the scrape of iron. People learned not to linger. You walked with purpose or you stayed inside. Anything else felt like an invitation.

Matthis stood in the yard behind the Death Guild’s sheds, arms folded tight against himself, watching the cages.

They’d reinforced them again. Thicker bars, tighter joins. It hadn’t helped.

The newest undead lay slumped in the far cage, its ribs half-collapsed inward as if the thing had tried to crawl out of itself. The flesh was already loosening, sloughing away in damp strips. The smell clung to the air—sweet, rancid, unmistakable.

Matthis swallowed and forced himself to keep watching.

By his count, it had been dead just under a day.

He’d started keeping track without meaning to. At first it was just a way to distract himself, something to do with his eyes that wasn’t flinching away. Then the patterns began to show themselves.

Flesh went first. Always within a day.
By the third, the bones paled—bleached, almost clean, like something scrubbed by tide and sun.
If left alone, they slowed. After a week without meat, even the liveliest would quiet, joints stiffening, skulls lolling uselessly. Not dead. Never dead. Just… waiting.

But feed them—just a scrap of raw flesh—and they woke again. Moaning. Scrabbling. That same blind hunger roaring back to life.

No thought. No recognition. Just want.

Matthis hated that he knew this now.

A voice cleared behind him. “You stare at them like they might start talking back.”

He turned.

Bartholomew stood a few paces away, soot still on his sleeves from the mine, dark curls plastered to his forehead with sweat. He carried a lantern in one hand and something else in the other—a small stone, no bigger than a walnut, veined with dull red lines that caught the light strangely.

Matthis’s first feeling was sharp and ugly.

Jealousy.

He crushed it down before it could show on his face. “If they start talking,” he said evenly, “I’ll quit on the spot.”

Bartholomew snorted and came closer, glancing at the cages with poorly hidden distaste. “Mine pays me to move rock, not… whatever this is. Still. Better you watching them than some poor bastard who’d run screaming.”

He held up the stone. “Found this today. Deep seam. Felt wrong to leave it.”

Matthis’s eyes followed it despite himself. He could feel it—*something*—a pressure behind his eyes, a faint pull, like standing near a drop you didn’t see coming.

“It’s beautiful,” he said, and meant it. The word tasted bitter anyway.

“Useful, I hope,” Bartholomew said. “Feels like it listens.”

Matthis managed a smile. “That’s more than most people in this town.”

Bartholomew studied him for a moment, then shrugged. “You still coming by the bakery later? Elspeth asked after you. Said you looked half-starved last time.”

“I’m fine,” Matthis said automatically.

“Mm.” Bartholomew didn’t argue. Wizards rarely did when they thought something already settled. “We found another one in the lower tunnel. Dead mage. Moving already.”

Matthis closed his eyes briefly, then nodded. “I’ll help restrain it.”

They worked without ceremony. Chains bit into bone. The undead thrashed weakly, jaw clacking, empty sockets rolling toward warmth it couldn’t name. Bartholomew muttered under his breath, the stone warming in his palm, lending his words a steadiness Matthis had never heard from him before.

By the time dusk bled into the trees, they had it bound tight.

They dragged it into the woods, far enough that the smoke wouldn’t drift back toward town. Someone had already built a firepit there—another quiet sign of how long this problem had been festering.

Matthis fed the fire until it roared.

As they hauled the skeleton closer, he felt it stir. Not violently. Restlessly. Even the bleached bones they passed rattled faintly, like teeth chattering in cold.

“What’s wrong with them?” he murmured. “They shouldn’t—”

“They feel you,” Bartholomew said, uneasily. “Or something about you.”

Matthis didn’t answer.

He thought of Elspeth instead. Of flour-dusted hands and the way she smiled at customers like the town hadn’t hollowed her out yet. Of how she spoke to him like he was still just Matthis.

They fed the skeleton into the fire piece by piece. Bartholomew held the stone out, focusing, his control tightening the blaze, guiding it. Bone blackened, cracked, collapsed. Ash rose thick and choking.

They didn’t stop until there was nothing left. Not a fragment. Not a shard.

When the fire finally died, the pit held only gray dust.

The woods were quiet.

Matthis waited for something to happen. For a moan. A rattle. Anything.

Nothing came.

Bartholomew let out a long breath, half laugh, half disbelief. “It’s… gone.”

Matthis stared at the ash. Something in his chest loosened painfully. “It worked.”

They didn’t speak much on the walk back.

That night, Matthis lay awake in his bunk, staring at the rafters. The book sat where he’d left it.

Then it wasn’t.

It slid halfway out of his bag, pages fluttering softly, insistent as breath.

He tried to ignore it.

Finally, hoarse with exhaustion, he whispered, “Why did that work?”

The book opened.

**Because you removed the residue of the Aether entirely.**

The word settled into him like a verdict.

**Wizards, witches, sorcerers—those in whom the flow runs strong—do not empty themselves at death. If the Aether remains, it seeks motion. Hunger. Form.**

Matthis clenched his fists. “So burying them—”

**Delays. Burning incompletely scatters the flow. Bone remembers. Ash does not.**

He swallowed. “And me?”

The pause felt deliberate.

**You are a striga. An incubus. Your dominion lies not in flame or stone, but in emotion. Loyalty. Desire. Fear.**

Disgust surged hot and sudden. “No.”

**They already look to you. You need not command. A gentle pressure would suffice. Feeding need not be violent. Slow bonds endure longer.**

“Enough.” He slammed the book shut, heart hammering.

The next day, he didn’t open it at all.

He helped cage another body. Watched it twitch. Watched the old bones stir when he passed.

He thought about ash.

And fire.

And how far he’d go to keep the people he cared about safe—without ever becoming what the book wanted him to be.

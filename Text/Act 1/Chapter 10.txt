The morning air was sharp with frost, and the mine entrance looked like a mouth yawning wide, black and unwelcoming. Matthis leaned against the wooden post of the guild’s yard, watching the workers arrive. Boots scuffed the gravel, cart wheels clattered, and already the smell of smoke and coal teased the edges of his senses.

The undead cages rattled faintly in the corner, restless even in their emptiness. Matthis’s eyes flicked toward them, but he didn’t linger. There was work to do, and he had started noticing things he hadn’t before—little cracks in the rhythm of the world.

He saw it first with the new attendant at the crematorium. A young man, hands trembling, unused to the heat of the coals. The pyres demanded precision, or the bones would scatter instead of burn cleanly. Matthis didn’t think. He moved near, resting a hand on the man’s shoulder. The effect was instant, subtle. The boy’s posture straightened, movements steadied.

“Steady now,” Matthis said softly.

The boy glanced up, eyes wide. “I—I don’t know how I—”

“You know. Trust yourself.” Matthis didn’t push. He didn’t explain. And yet the flames flared brighter, hotter, consuming the skeleton in perfect ash. Not a single fragment remained.

Matthis stepped back, startled. There had been no effort, no drain. Wizards had always been different—using power left them hollow, breath shallow, muscles quivering. He felt… nothing. Whole. More.

He glanced down at the book, lying innocently in his satchel. Open, blank, inert.

*Dismissive*, the book whispered without words, as if noting his surprise. *Not all flow is finite. Not all power consumes.*

He swallowed, nodding to himself. The words didn’t come through in letters; the meaning, the *essence* of the book, was enough.

The next hours passed with quiet observation. Matthis began noticing patterns he hadn’t before. How a miner’s knuckles whitened around a pick, how the smith’s hammer faltered when fatigue crept, how the assistants at the guild fumbled chains if they weren’t confident. And with each, he found himself adjusting—not teaching, not guiding overtly—but simply being near. He whispered encouragement to one, shared a glance with another, rested a hand lightly here or there. And each time, the effect rippled outward.

By midday, the piles of ash in the crematorium were neatly uniform. Not a single undead stirred. The workers looked at him differently, just slightly. Not in awe, not with fear, but as if someone had reminded them to trust themselves—and someone had.

Later, he walked through the square, the weight of the day on his shoulders, but lighter than it should have been. Children skated along the frost-crusted stones, boots of adults leaving sharp echoes. And there was Elspeth, leaning over the counter at the bakery, dusting her hands on her apron.

“Matthis,” she said warmly, not quite surprised to see him, but pleased. “You’ve been busy.”

“I’ve… been helping,” he said.

Her smile was a question and an answer all at once. “It shows.”

Matthis shifted his weight, uncertain, and then decided to speak plainly. “I didn’t mean to scare anyone yesterday. Or… make them look at me differently.”

Her laughter was soft, like a bell through fog. “The town looks at everyone differently, Matthis. Don’t take it personally. They notice you because you act.”

“Act?”

“Yes. You *do*, rather than wait for the world to happen to you. That’s all anyone wants from anyone else.”

Matthis considered that. He glanced down at his hands. He had shared something without thinking. His presence had steadied others, the flames, even the ash itself. His fingers itched slightly—not in need, but in anticipation.

He had power. And not the kind that left him hollow. The kind that made others *better*.

The evening came, gray and slow. Matthis returned to the woods where they had burned the undead yesterday. He stood above the pit, looking down at the smooth gray of ash. The wind stirred the smoke from distant fires, carrying the scent of coal and char and pine.

He saw the new attendant from the crematorium working alone, feeding coals carefully, adjusting bones for the next burn. His movements were deliberate, precise—Matthis had done nothing but stand near earlier, and now the boy executed perfectly.

Matthis exhaled, the tension of weeks loosening in his chest. The guild master might still fear him, the villagers might whisper, the book might wait for him in the shadows. But here, now, he could see the results of his choices, of subtle guidance and presence.

No one screamed. No one died. And yet, power had been shared. Influence had rippled outward.

He leaned on a fence post and let the quiet wash over him, looking at the smoldering remains of what had once been undead. A faint smile tugged at his lips.

Someone else might have wielded fire. Someone else might have burned. But he had made ash *matter*, not just to the bones, but to the people who handled them. And that—he realized—was far more satisfying than any strength he’d felt alone.

Across the square, the bakery door opened, and Elspeth called softly, “Matthis. Supper later? I saved you a roll.”

He nodded, feeling the warmth of her smile follow him like a quiet tide, and for the first time in days, he felt like he might belong—not by magic, not by power, but by *presence*.

If you want, the **next step** could show:

* Matthis testing his influence more deliberately—seeing limits and unintended effects.
* Another casual scene with Elspeth that shows *trust and subtle admiration*.
* The book intruding just enough to tease him, without overt coercion.

We can also start **hinting at the hierarchy of striga and magical beings** through these interactions.

Do you want me to move directly into that next stage?

The morning smelled of coal smoke and wet cobblestones. Matthis trailed behind her, careful to keep just the right distance, letting her work while keeping the small pulse of life she carried close. He didn’t think about it as hunger, exactly—more a sense of rhythm, of energy flowing and settling around her, around himself.

The book had been heavy in his pack, silent, but present. Not in words yet. Not in speech. Just pressure, nudges he barely noticed, like shadows brushing the edges of his thoughts.

*Observe. Notice what rises.*

He ignored it. Mostly.

She bent over a crate of herbs, counting, sorting, arranging. His fingers itched to help, to touch the small, fragile movements. Not to command. Not to steal. Just… to be part of it.

*It could be yours.*

The thought was almost a whisper, barely there, and he recoiled. He shook his head, trying to clear it. *No. Not that. Not her.*

But the pull didn’t go away. He felt it when her hand brushed against his briefly while he helped lift a bundle. The brush was fleeting, nothing meant, and yet… it lingered inside him like the first spark of a fire he didn’t know how to control.

The book’s nudges were subtler now, suggesting shapes, patterns: *attention follows desire. Strength comes from taking what rises.*

He shook his head again. No, no. That was… *wrong*.

And yet, the pull persisted. That night, when the market emptied and the air cooled, he followed her back to the small house she rented above the bakery. Not close enough to intrude. Just enough to feel the rhythm of her living, the small pulses of her body in rest, in routine, in private.

The sensation was intoxicating. Not warmth. Not hunger. Something sharper: a resonance, a tether, an almost imperceptible drain. Not enough to injure her, not enough for her to notice. But enough to settle into him like sleep.

When he realized what he had done, his stomach twisted.

*No,* he whispered. *I didn’t—*

But he had. A single, quiet misstep. A theft of energy so subtle she never paused, never flinched, never noticed. And yet…

Something shifted.

Her attention, the trust he had been careful to cultivate, faltered in ways he couldn’t see. The next morning, her smile was faintly distant. Her laughter carried a small, unplaceable weight. And when he tried to help with the crates, she stiffened just enough that he felt it in his chest: a ripple of doubt, a crack in the rhythm they had shared.

He didn’t understand why it hurt so much. Not fully. He only knew that the invisible line he had crossed left him hollow, exposed, afraid of what the book would teach him next.

*Observe what rises.*

He clenched his fists. The whisper lingered in the back of his mind, patient, waiting.

*And take it.*

Matthis leaned against the wall of the market street, breathing hard, and for the first time realized the weight of the difference in himself. He was no longer simply a miner who could help lift crates. He was something else. Something that could reach into the currents of life around him.

And already, he was beginning to learn what that meant—and what it could cost.

The evening air smelled of coal smoke and sweet bread. Matthis rounded the corner to the small lane behind the bakery, hoping to catch a familiar light in the window. He wasn’t usually this late; the market had emptied hours ago, and most folk were home with their families.

But there she was—Elspeth—bent over a bundle of herbs, tying them carefully with frayed linen. Candlelight glinted off her hair as she moved, and for a moment, he hesitated. Something about her posture, the careful way she worked even now, made him pause.

“Elspeth,” he said softly.

She jerked upright, startled, though only for a heartbeat. Then a faint, knowing smile curved her lips.

“Matthis. You’re late,” she said, voice low. “The market’s been dead for hours. Thought you’d be home already.”

“I—I had things to check,” he said, keeping his tone casual. “You?”

“Some deliveries went wrong,” she said, eyes flicking toward the bakery. “Had to fix them before anyone noticed.”

He nodded, feeling the familiar rhythm between them. The easy banter, the small pauses that carried the weight of what was unsaid. They’d always had a way of speaking around things, a language of gestures, glances, and half-finished sentences.

“I—I was hoping to find something today,” he said, careful not to sound eager. “An artifact, like the wizard’s. Something useful.”

Elspeth raised an eyebrow. “Useful how?”

He shrugged, casual. “You know. Something that… helps.”

Her eyes lingered on his face, searching, teasing, but he couldn’t tell if it was for curiosity or warning. “The mine’s dangerous. You could get yourself hurt chasing things that might not exist.”

“I know,” he said quickly, keeping his tone light. But inside, the shard in his bag hummed faintly, a presence he could not let her sense. *Not yet. Not her.*

She sighed, running a hand through her hair. “You always have to poke around where you shouldn’t. You never change, do you?”

He smiled faintly. “Someone has to. Otherwise, who’ll notice the things that matter?”

She didn’t answer at once. Instead, she moved closer to him, brushing past his shoulder as she carried a small bundle of herbs to the bakery door. Their fingers grazed. The air shifted. A spark, subtle and imperceptible, ran along his skin.

Matthis swallowed. The pull was there—warmth, attention, something rising—but it wasn’t hunger. Not yet. Just *something*.

“You know,” she said quietly, “I like it when you help. Makes me feel… safer. Even when you’re late.”

He chuckled, but it was nervous, edge-thin. “I’ll try not to get myself killed, then.”

Her hand lingered on the door frame, brushing his arm as she passed. The air thickened, charged. Matthis’s pulse jumped, and before he could think, he leaned in.

It was quick. Not planned. Not wanted. Just… instinct. Lips brushing hers, a fleeting warmth, a spark that vanished as quickly as it came.

Her eyes widened. Shock, confusion, something else—something silent, something that made his stomach twist. He stepped back immediately.

“I—I didn’t—” he stammered.

Elspeth didn’t speak. She only looked at him, eyes soft, questioning, hurt. The smallest crease of tension between her brows. The moment was gone, but it left a hollow in the air, a missing weight neither of them could name.

Finally, she said, quietly, almost to herself, “Matthis…”

He wanted to explain. Wanted to tell her it had been nothing, that he hadn’t meant it—but he couldn’t. The shard in his bag pulsed faintly against his ribs. Whatever he had taken, whatever had happened in that instant, it had already changed him.

Her hand hovered near his, hesitated, then dropped. She gave him a look—soft, lingering, full of trust and confusion—and pressed her lips lightly to his cheek, a silent acknowledgment of what had shifted.

Matthis swallowed, guilt clenching at his chest. He wanted to run back to the mine, to the shard, to the book, anything to hide from the weight of what he had done. But he stayed, frozen, feeling the faint, residual pull of the energy he had taken and the quiet heartbreak in her eyes.

He had crossed a line.

And he didn’t yet know the consequences.

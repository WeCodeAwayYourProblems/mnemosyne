Sleep never came.

Matthis lay on his bunk until the snoring around him thickened and thinned again, until the barracks settled into its nightly creaks and sighs. His body rested but did not sink. Muscles stayed coiled, alert, as though waiting for a signal that never arrived.

After a while, he gave up pretending.

He dressed quietly and took his lantern, though he did not light it at first. The mine mouth loomed black and patient beyond the guild yard. Night air slid over his skin, cool and damp, and he realized with faint surprise that the cold did not bite the way it should have.

He stepped inside.

The tunnels felt different at night—emptier, wider. His footsteps rang too loud. Somewhere far off, water dripped in a steady, unhurried rhythm. He moved deeper without effort, climbing where he would once have hauled himself hand over hand. His fingers found holds before his eyes did. His legs responded instantly, no lag, no burn.

He tested it without meaning to.

A jump across a gap. A pull straight up a wall of broken stone. His body answered him smoothly, obediently, like a well-made tool.

The thought unsettled him enough that he turned toward the old passage—the one that should have led back to the chamber.

The turn was gone.

Not collapsed. Not blocked.

Gone.

The wall where the opening had been was solid stone, uninterrupted, dustless. He ran his hands over it, heart thudding. No seam. No draft. No echo.

As if the mine had never opened there at all.

He stepped back, breath shallow, and that was when the ladder failed.

The rung snapped beneath his weight with a sound like a gunshot. The world tilted. The shaft yawned open and swallowed him.

He fell.

The lantern spun away, its light streaking uselessly across stone. Air tore past his ears. He tried to grab the wall and missed everything. The drop went on and on, long enough for fear to bloom fully and rot into certainty.

Then the ground came up and broke him.

Pain arrived everywhere at once. He skidded across wet stone, slammed into rubble, and lay still, lungs refusing to draw air. Something in his arm bent the wrong way. His knee screamed when he tried to move it. The dark pressed close, intimate and complete.

When he finally dragged breath back into his body, it came ragged and thin.

He tried to stand.

His leg folded. He cried out before he could stop himself, the sound torn and ugly. Sweat broke out along his spine. This—this was exhaustion. Not the steady ache of work, but a deep, consuming weakness that hollowed him out.

He lay there a long time.

Eventually, he crawled.

The passage sloped downward, natural stone slick with moisture. He dragged his useless arm behind him, teeth clenched hard enough that his jaw ached. His vision swam, the edges of the dark fuzzier than before. He noticed it dimly, distantly—how the shadows swallowed more than they had earlier.

Something had been taken from him.

The smell hit first.

Wet earth. Blood. The faint, sour tang of fear.

He rounded a bend and found the wizard.

The man lay half-buried where a ceiling collapse had spilled stone and mud into a shallow cavern. One leg twisted beneath him. His chest rose and fell in shallow, frantic jerks. One hand clawed weakly at the rubble, fingers raw and bleeding.

He was alive.

Matthis felt it immediately—not just the warmth of breath, but everything else. The tight, choking terror pressing inward. The frantic confusion, looping without end. A dull, aching pull toward something warm and familiar that no longer existed here.

Home.

The man had so much left. Resolve clung to him stubbornly, refusing to let go even as his body failed.

Matthis swallowed hard.

So that’s why, he thought dimly. Why they hadn’t found him. Why he hadn’t turned.

He pushed himself upright, bracing against the wall. Pain flared, white and blinding. He bit it down and stepped toward the wizard, already planning how to lift him, how to brace his weight, how to—

The book slipped free.

It struck the stone with a dull, soft sound and fell open.

Blank pages stared up at him.

“No,” Matthis hissed, dropping to his knees. He reached for it—

It slid from his grasp and landed against the rubble beside the trapped man.

Still blank.

“What’s happening?” he whispered, panic edging his voice.

Ink bloomed.

**FEED.**

The word landed inside him like a command given to something that had been waiting.

He felt it then—the pull. Not from the book.

From the man.

Something opened inside Matthis, wider than breath. The despair, the fear, the aching confusion surged toward him, drawn out as though by a current. The wizard gasped, eyes fluttering.

Matthis jerked back. “Stop—!”

But it didn’t stop.

Energy flooded him—hot, intoxicating, endless. It poured through his broken arm, knitting bone with a wet, grinding sensation. His knee snapped back into place. Bruises faded. Strength surged until his hands shook with it.

The dark sharpened. Every contour leapt into clarity. He felt enormous, inexhaustible, as though the mine itself were too small to contain him.

The wizard’s eyes flew open.

His mouth worked soundlessly. Then a harsh, wet breath rattled out of him—and did not come again.

The pull ceased.

Silence rushed in.

Matthis staggered back, heart pounding so hard it hurt. He stared at the body, at the slack face and glassy eyes.

“I didn’t—” His voice broke. “I didn’t touch him.”

The book’s pages turned.

New words formed, slow and deliberate, sinking into the paper as if etched there by memory itself:

**POWER LIES IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE AROUND YOU.**
**BREATHE IT.**
**TAKE IT.**
**IT IS YOURS.**

Matthis looked down at his hands.

They were steady.

Too steady.

Behind him, the mine waited—full of people, full of feeling, full of everything he had never known he could reach.

And somewhere deep inside, hunger stirred again.

The streets of the mining town were narrow and clogged with dust and mud, the smell of iron and smoke thick in the air. The taverns along the main street were crowded with men pretending at gaiety, pitchers of ale swinging in hands scarred from years underground. A few establishments had begun to wear the masks of brothels, but the town hadn’t yet learned to blend vice and business seamlessly. People crossed the street when they saw Matthis, or muttered under their breath—*Death Guild boy, corpse-bound wretch*—and children hid behind their parents’ skirts.

The Guild of Custodians sat at the edge of town, beyond the last row of miners’ homes. Matthis walked past the cages, his boots crunching over gravel, and paused. He had begun to notice the subtle rhythms of the undead within. The flesh decayed at a precise rate—thin, ragged strips falling away within a day, leaving bone exposed. By the third day, the bones were white and brittle, almost porcelain in the cold sunlight.

If left unfed, they stilled in about a week, their rattling ceasing to a quiet, sinister silence. But give them a bit of raw flesh—the only thing they could consume—and they would awaken, moaning and shuffling in the cages as if no time had passed. Intelligence was absent; they hungered only. The patterns were simple, predictable, and yet they unsettled him in ways he could not name.

A voice cut through his thoughts. “Matthis,” said a deep, even tone. He turned to see the wizard approaching from the mine entrance, robes dusted with soot. The man’s eyes glinted with amusement. “You’ve been staring at the bones again, haven’t you?”

“I—yes,” Matthis admitted, brushing dust from his sleeves. “I can’t help it. They move… and yet they don’t. It’s strange.”

The wizard smiled faintly. “Strange, yes. But necessary. Keep observing; patterns tell us what to expect.” He extended a hand, holding a small, roughly hewn stone, faintly glowing with an inner light. “Found this down in the western shaft. Might help stabilize your wards, or maybe something more.”

Matthis’ stomach tightened. A flash of jealousy rose. The wizard—*Bartholomew*—had skill, power, and connections; and now he had a stone, a tool that might make him stronger still. He forced a smile, forcing kindness into his tone. “That’s… impressive. Good work, Bartholomew. I hope it helps you.”

Bartholomew chuckled. “You’d like it for yourself, I’ll wager. You don’t need to hide it.”

Matthis shook his head, voice low. “I’m glad you found it. Really. It’s… inspiring, to see someone else handle their fate.”

Bartholomew raised an eyebrow. “Handle your own, you mean.” He gave a wink and moved toward the mine entrance.

Matthis lingered, letting his gaze drift toward the bakery on the corner. The warm glow of lamps spilled onto the street, and through the open doorway he saw Elspeth, her hands dusted with flour, laughing as she helped a customer. Her smile—rare in this town—made something ache in his chest. She looked up and spotted him.

“Matthis!” she called, her voice bright, carrying across the street. “Done with the bones for today?”

He gave a small nod, smiling despite the heaviness in his gut. “Yes. You… still smiling, even with all this dust and death around?”

She laughed softly. “It’s the little joys, isn’t it? Flour, bread, a friendly face. We hold on where we can.”

He noticed the faint line of weariness beneath her eyes, the shadows that lingered despite the cheer. She was one of the few people in this town whose brightness hadn’t been dimmed entirely. They talked briefly of the guild and her work at the bakery. When he finally turned back toward the mine, her smile lingered in his mind, sharp as the scent of fresh bread.

Walking alone through the alleys and toward the mine’s entrance, Matthis considered why his chest had tightened at Bartholomew’s stone. It wasn’t envy of the wizard himself—he liked the man—but of what Bartholomew held: control over destiny. Power. Choice. Matthis’ own path felt small, constrained by observation, attendance, and careful handling of corpses. And yet… that small spark of ambition had been kindled.

The mine yawned before him, dark and endless. The shafts were cold and sharp with the scent of stone and sweat, the metal of pickaxes and supports glinting faintly. Beyond preventing dead miners from becoming undead, Matthis felt something else drawing him deeper: a hope, vague and urgent, of discovery. Something hidden among the rocks, the dust, the whispers of energy that lingered where life had ended.

And he would find it.

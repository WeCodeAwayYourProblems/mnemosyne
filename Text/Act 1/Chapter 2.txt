The book waited.

Matthis stood where he was, afraid that moving too quickly would make this place notice him harder. The chamber didn’t feel abandoned. It felt *paused*, like a held breath that had gone on too long.

He took another step. Then another.

The floor was etched with circles and lines that curved back on themselves, patterns that refused to settle into anything familiar. They made his eyes ache if he stared too long. He didn’t try to read them. Reading was for people who had learned how.

The lectern was stone, polished smooth by time or care. The book rested on it like it belonged nowhere else.

He reached out—and stopped.

The pressure was back. Not resistance. Expectation.

“Alright,” he whispered again, though he didn’t know who he was speaking to. “I’m here.”

His fingers brushed the cover.

The contact sent a sharp, clean sensation through his skull, like cold water poured behind the eyes. He gasped and pulled his hand back, heart racing.

*—do not be afraid—*

The words didn’t sound.

They *arrived*.

Not as a voice, not as sound, but as understanding, sudden and undeniable. The meaning pressed itself into him fully formed, leaving no room to argue.

He staggered, one hand braced on the lectern.

“Who—” His voice cracked. “What are you?”

The book remained closed.

The pressure eased again, just enough to let him breathe.

He realized, distantly, that he could feel his own thoughts more clearly than usual, like they’d been pulled closer to the surface. Memories flickered at odd angles—faces from the mine, the wizard’s laughter, the warmth of the strange stone in his palm—then settled.

*—you may ask—*

The words weren’t kind. They weren’t cruel. They were *precise*.

Matthis swallowed. His throat felt dry, scraped raw.

“Where am I?”

The cover creaked softly as the book opened itself.

Its pages were blank.

Not empty—blank in the way fresh snow is blank, hiding depth under smoothness. He leaned closer despite himself. The air around the book was cooler, heavier, like the space just before a storm.

The meaning came again, paired now with faint impressions on the page—shadows of letters that vanished when he tried to focus on them.

*—a place of work—*

His stomach twisted.

“What work?”

The page shifted.

This time, something *stuck*.

A single line of ink bled up from the page as if drawn from beneath the surface, the letters unfamiliar but somehow legible all the same.

*Potential requires form.*

The sentence echoed in his head at the same time it appeared on the page, the meaning settling into him like a truth he’d always half-known.

He frowned. “I don’t—”

*—you do—*

The pressure sharpened, not painful, but insistent. He became acutely aware of himself: the ache in his shoulders, the thinness of his boots, the constant low hunger that never quite went away. The way people looked past him until they needed something.

The page turned.

Images followed—not pictures, not exactly. Sensations. Impressions of people leaning close, voices lowered, attention focused entirely on him. A warmth spreading outward from his chest, filling empty places. The relief of being *wanted*.

He flinched.

“I don’t want that,” he said quickly, though he wasn’t entirely sure what *that* was.

The book did not argue.

Instead, it offered something else.

The image shifted: his hands steady over stone, exhaustion easing as strength flowed back into him. The mine no longer pressing so hard. The sense of being full without eating. Safe without hiding.

*—sustainability—* the meaning pressed in. *—continuity—*

That word lingered.

Continuity.

Matthis exhaled slowly. “You can… help me stay alive.”

Not a question.

The book turned another page.

This time, the writing came faster, darker, the ink sinking deep into the page as if eager.

*Activation requires proximity.*

The words were accompanied by a pull, subtle but undeniable, drawing his attention away from the lectern and toward the far end of the chamber.

He followed it with his eyes.

There, half-hidden behind a table of instruments, stood a frame of blackened metal shaped like a tall oval. Its surface shimmered faintly, like oil on water, though nothing moved. Chains lay coiled at its base, not fastened to anything.

Matthis’s pulse quickened.

“That?” he asked.

*—yes—*

His feet moved before he’d fully decided to let them.

Each step toward the frame made the air feel thicker, warmer. His skin prickled, nerves waking as if from long neglect. The book’s presence stayed with him, not behind his eyes now but threaded through his thoughts, guiding without pushing.

He stopped just short of the frame.

Something about it felt… intimate. Not in any way he could name cleanly. Like standing too close to someone’s thoughts.

“What does it do?” he asked.

The hesitation was noted.

The response was immediate.

*—it aligns you—*

The meaning that followed was vast and indistinct: survival without theft, hunger without harm, connection without chains. It washed over him in comforting generalities, smoothing the sharp edges of doubt.

Matthis nodded slowly.

“Alright,” he said, more to himself than anything else. “Alright.”

He stepped into the frame.

The world folded.

Heat and cold tore through him at once, a tearing sensation deep in his chest that made him cry out. His vision went white, then black, then filled with colors that had no names. Every nerve sang, stretched tight as wire, then *re-tuned*.

He fell to his knees.

The pain passed quickly. Too quickly.

Breathing hard, he waited for the aftershock, for the cost. None came. Instead, a strange clarity settled over him, his thoughts snapping into sharper focus. He could feel the room more distinctly now—not just its shape, but its *mood*. The lingering echoes of intent, the residue of old desires pressed into stone.

The frame behind him cooled, its shimmer fading.

The book closed with a soft, final sound.

Matthis pushed himself upright, unsteady but unhurt. He looked down at his hands. They were the same. Scarred, callused. Human.

Relief washed through him.

Then something else followed.

A low, unfamiliar pull deep in his gut. Not hunger exactly. Not pain. A pressure, like a question his body was asking without words.

He swallowed.

The room felt louder now. Not in sound—in *presence*. The thought of another person nearby sent a faint ripple through him, a tug that made his pulse quicken for no reason he understood.

“That’s not right,” he murmured.

The book did not respond.

But as he turned away from the lectern, toward the chamber’s far wall, he became aware of one final change:

For the first time in his life, he could feel how close he was to other people—even when none were there.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, a quiet, patient satisfaction settled in, as if a long-laid plan had advanced exactly one step.

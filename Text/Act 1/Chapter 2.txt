Matthis did not go straight to the mine.
He told himself it was because the morning was still young, because the sun had not yet climbed high enough to burn the fog off the lower slopes of the Blackveins. He told himself it was because he had not eaten. Both were true. Neither was the reason.
The Staff and Flagon squatted near the center of Coalridge, its stone walls dark with old smoke and newer soot. It was less a tavern than a public house in the older sense of the word—wide doors, low beams, long tables scarred with knife marks and burns. It smelled of boiled grain, fat, and woodsmoke. A place for meals, not indulgence.
Matthis paused with his hand on the door latch. From inside came the low murmur of voices, the scrape of bowls, the dull clunk of tankards set down too hard. Life, continuing. His chest tightened at that, and he pushed inside before he could think better of it.
The common room was already half-full. Miners hunched over breakfast, shoulders rounded, faces gray with coal dust that never quite washed off. A few new faces, too—men and women he didn’t recognize, clothes patched but serviceable. Coalridge was bigger than it had been a year ago. Somehow.
Heat rolled over him as the door shut behind him. The hearth was going strong, and beyond it, through a half wall, came the sharper smells of the kitchen.
“Elspeth,” called someone from a table near the fire. “If that stew’s ready, I’ll marry it.”
“Get in line,” came her voice back, dry but warm. “And don’t rush me unless you want it burnt.”
Matthis moved to the side, out of the way. He didn’t sit. He stood there, hands loose at his sides, feeling awkward and conspicuous in his ash-stained coat. He could feel eyes on him—not hostile, not friendly. Acknowledgment, and then dismissal. The Death Guild did not belong in places like this.
Elspeth emerged from the kitchen carrying a wooden tray loaded with bowls. She moved with an economy that spoke of long habit, sleeves rolled up, hair pinned back with a bone clasp gone smooth from use. She set the bowls down one by one, trading words, collecting coins without counting them twice.
When she turned and saw him, she didn’t startle. Didn’t stiffen. Her eyes flicked to his face, then to his hands, then back again.
“You look thin,” she said, as if continuing a conversation they’d already been having. “Sit.”
“I don’t—” Matthis began.
“Sit,” she repeated, and nudged a bench out with her foot.
He obeyed.
She disappeared back into the kitchen before he could decide what to say. He sat there, spine straight, feeling the hum of the room around him. Someone laughed. Someone else coughed deep and wet. A spoon scraped the bottom of a bowl.
He realized, distantly, that his hands were trembling. He curled them into fists and rested them on his knees.
Elspeth returned with a plate and set it in front of him. Thick bread, dark and dense, the crust split where it had risen too much for its own good. A wedge of cheese beside it, pale and crumbly, still sweating faintly.
“Eat,” she said.
He broke the bread. Steam ghosted up from the center, carrying the smell of grain and something else—herbs, maybe, or just care. He took a bite.
The bread was heavy, but not leaden. It filled his mouth, warm and grounding, and when he swallowed he felt it settle, solid and sure, like a weight placed exactly where it needed to be. The cheese followed, sharp and clean.
He hadn’t realized how hungry he was until that moment. He ate more quickly than he meant to, then slowed, embarrassed.
Elspeth leaned against the table across from him, arms folded loosely. She watched him without staring.
“You’re not here for breakfast,” she said.
“No,” he admitted.
She nodded, as if that confirmed something. “Then have another piece.”
She broke the loaf and added it to his plate, along with a heel she must have been saving for herself.
“You don’t have to—”
“I do,” she said. “For the same reason you do.”
He looked up at her then. “And what reason is that?”
“So things don’t fall apart all at once.”
She pushed off the table and went back to the kitchen before he could answer.
By the time he finished eating, the trembling had eased. His chest still felt tight, but there was strength under it now, a steadiness he hadn’t expected. He stood, left coins on the table, and hesitated.
“Elspeth,” he said.
She glanced back over her shoulder. “Yes?”
“Thank you.”
She smiled—not wide, not bright. Just enough. “Come back after,” she said. “You’ll need supper.”
After.
He stepped back out into the street.
Coalridge stretched wider than he remembered. New hostels leaned against old ones. Timber frames still raw and pale stood beside blackened stone. The town had grown like a scar that refused to stop healing, piling tissue on tissue whether it made sense or not.
He walked past the graveyard on the hill, where wooden markers leaned at odd angles and stone ones bore names carved too hastily. Twenty-two graves from the cave-in. Seventeen quiet forever.
Five that had not stayed so.
He remembered the week after the disaster—the smell, first. Then the way the ground had shifted, just slightly, as if something beneath it were stretching. The way the first grave had split open like a cracked tooth.
It had taken a week for the wizards to claw their way back into the world.
The others had stayed buried.
Why?
Other wizards had died since. Accidents. Illness. Exhaustion. Some rose. Some didn’t. There was no pattern he could see. No rule he could point to.
Yet.
He turned away from the graves and followed the road as it narrowed, climbed, and finally gave way to packed earth and old rails half-swallowed by weeds.
The mouth of the Coalridge Pit loomed ahead, a jagged wound cut into the mountain’s flesh. Timber supports framed it like ribs. The darkness inside was absolute, swallowing the daylight just a few feet in.
The mine breathed. He could hear it—the slow, damp exhale of air moving where it shouldn’t, the distant creak of wood under weight. The mountain did not care that he stood there. It had already proven that.
Matthis stopped at the edge of the light.
He did not tell himself he was afraid. He told himself he was careful. He adjusted the strap of his satchel, checked the lamp at his belt, and stepped forward.
The darkness took him whole.
The mine closed around him, and for the first time since the disaster, Matthis walked back inside, toward answers that did not want to be found.

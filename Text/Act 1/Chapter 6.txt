Got it. Let’s make this next chapter **long, immersive, and layered**. The book (Mnemosyne of Power) will start **exerting influence**, showing its self-writing pages and teaching him *about the world beyond himself*, including witches, warlocks, and striga—but without overtly tempting him to use his power. The allure comes from curiosity, knowledge, and the book’s uncanny ability to communicate directly.

We’ll keep **close psychic distance**, slow revelation, tension, and the “pull” of the book’s mysterious presence.

### Chapter Six

The room was quiet except for the faint creak of the floorboards under his boots. Matthis set the lantern on the table, its light flickering against the dust-smeared walls. The book rested there, heavy and still, as if it were breathing.

He sat, hands brushing over the worn cover. A chill ran through him—not cold, exactly, but the sense that he was being watched by something that had always been there. Something patient.

*Open me.*

The thought didn’t sound like a voice. It slid into him, clear and deliberate. He hesitated, swallowing. The book had never spoken this way before. It had only whispered in impressions, nudges behind his thoughts. Now it demanded attention.

He lifted the cover. The pages were blank.

*No,* he thought, and the thought wasn’t entirely his own. *Wait.*

Ink appeared on the page, curling slowly like mist over still water, forming letters that seemed to shimmer with a light of their own.

*You are ready to see.*

Matthis leaned closer. The letters were unfamiliar, but not unreadable. The meaning arrived in his mind before he even fully recognized the shapes. A comprehension that was not learned, but granted.

*I am Mnemosyne of Power,* the page said. And in the same instant, the thought echoed in his head, a dual voice both inside and outside. *Remember, learn, ascend.*

He gasped, heart hammering. “Mnemosyne…” he whispered aloud. The name felt like a key, like a pulse he had been missing all his life.

The next page shifted before he could turn it. Letters formed as if pulled from the air, forming diagrams and symbols, annotations that danced across the paper, bold then faint, curling and folding into themselves.

*There are others,* the book’s thought came, not loud, but irresistible. *Witches. Warlocks. Sorcerers. They walk this world as you do, unseen, yet potent. They are not bound by the flame alone. Observe them. Learn from them. They are… different.*

Matthis blinked. “Different how?”

*Different in form. In method. In the flow of power they command.* The ink on the page shifted, showing vague shapes: figures bent over cauldrons, hands drawing sigils in the air, and creatures with long shadows that slithered just beyond comprehension. *Some bend objects to their will. Others to themselves. Some… walk the line between life and unlife.*

He swallowed hard. His mind turned over the words like rough stones. Warlocks? Witches? Striga? The shapes moved in his mind, impossible yet real.

*Yes. Learn the flow. Learn to read it.*

The letters curled again, revealing instructions—not on using magic, but on perceiving it. How to recognize its echo in the world. How to see the faint threads of magical energy that threaded through people, objects, places. How to notice when it had been manipulated, altered, drawn, or withheld.

Matthis felt a thrill. Not power, not hunger. Curiosity. A pull toward knowledge that made his chest tighten, made his fingers itch to touch, to turn the pages faster than he could.

*I am the guide. You are the learner. Do not mistake the two. Your hands are small, but your mind… can grow.*

He paused. The book’s words were not just ink. They were pressure, a presence in his skull, a weight and a warmth, insistently gentle. And yet he knew, somewhere, that Mnemosyne could claim more than his attention if he allowed it.

*There are others like you, if you choose to see them. If you choose to reach.*

The diagrams shifted again, showing faint outlines of beings that were clearly human, and others that twisted subtly, hints of something not fully alive, something… altered. Striga, the name whispered into him without letters, without ink.

Matthis leaned back, heart hammering. He had never imagined such a world. Wizards had been the limit of what he knew. Now there were creatures that could steal, twist, and endure—humans transformed into forms that were beautiful, terrible, and potent.

*You may follow them. You may find them. You may learn.*

He exhaled. Excitement prickled under his skin. The pull was not hunger. Not yet. But something promised itself in the quiet of the lamp-lit room: adventure, discovery, knowledge beyond the ordinary.

*Do you wish to continue?*

He looked down at the open page. The letters shimmered, a heartbeat under glass. *Yes.* He whispered it, and the word vibrated in his mind, as if answered by the book itself.

The words rearranged themselves again, showing faint hints of a map—not of land, but of ideas, flows, and possibilities. He could almost feel the presence of witches, warlocks, and hidden sorcerers in the world. Some near, some distant. All waiting to be noticed.

Mnemosyne’s voice—or thought—slid into him with subtle insistence, a gentle tug: *Observe, and follow. Seek, and find. The world is not as it seems. And you… you may be ready.*

Matthis’s hands trembled slightly. Excitement and fear wove through him like threads of fire. He wanted to reach out, touch the page again, drink in the knowledge, see more.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, he sensed the first trace of temptation—the allure of *what might be learned*, of *what might be seen*, and the way Mnemosyne’s presence made it feel urgent, inevitable.

He closed the book briefly, just to catch his breath. Its weight in his hands was heavier than before, not by mass but by something else—something that felt like promise and warning folded into one.

He opened it again. The letters were waiting, shifting, shimmering, forming new instructions, new impressions. He was beginning to understand them. Beginning to see the *thread of power that moved through the world*.

And he knew, without doubt, that he would follow it.

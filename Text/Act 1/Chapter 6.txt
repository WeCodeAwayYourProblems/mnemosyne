The wizard was heavier than he should have been.
Not in flesh—Matthis knew that weight well—but in consequence. Every step dragged. Every shift of the body across his shoulders felt like a judgment. The man’s arm hung limp across Matthis’s chest, cold already, knocking softly against him with each step like an accusation that refused to be silent.
The mine pressed in.
The tunnels narrowed as he climbed, ceilings lowering until he had to hunch. The walls sweated. Water dripped steadily, marking time he could not undo. His breath echoed too loud in his ears. He kept expecting to feel hands clutching at him from the dark—bony fingers, gnashing teeth—but nothing stirred. No moaning. No movement.
Only him.
Only what he’d done.
The book did it, he told himself, again and again. It made me.
The thought didn’t help. The strength in his legs betrayed him, carrying him upward without falter. His lungs never burned. His arms didn’t shake. The mine that had always demanded payment from his body gave him none tonight, and that felt worse than pain.
He wanted to be exhausted. Wanted to collapse. Wanted some part of this to cost him what it should.
When the slope steepened near the upper galleries, shame thickened like smoke. He remembered the man’s eyes snapping open. The final breath. The way the pull had felt—easy. Natural.
He bit down hard on the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood.
I’m not like this, he thought. I wasn’t.
The dark did not argue. It simply closed around him, patient and suffocating, until at last he saw daylight—thin at first, a blade of gray cutting through the black.
Escape felt wrong.
He emerged from the mine at dusk. The sky had gone bruised-purple, clouds piled low and heavy over the town. Lamps were being lit. Smoke curled from chimneys. The world went on.
Someone whistled.
“Saints preserve us—Matthis?”
He stepped fully into the light, the body still on his shoulder.
Conversations stopped.
A miner crossed himself. Another stared openly. Someone laughed, sharp and nervous.
“Did you carry him out alone?”
Matthis didn’t answer. He couldn’t trust his voice.
“You look—by the pit,” a man muttered. “Did they give you wizard’s work now?”
A guild clerk hurried over, eyes flicking to the corpse, then back to Matthis. “That’s good work,” he said, reverent despite himself. “Fast. Clean. You did right.”
Hands clapped his back. Words piled up—strong, quick, never seen the like. Someone said he should be promoted. Someone else said the Death Guild had finally earned its name.
Matthis nodded where he had to. Let them guide him. Let them take the body.
Their praise slid off him like rain on stone.
Once, he would have held onto it. Once, a word of approval could have warmed him for days. Now it curdled in his gut. Every congratulation felt stolen.
He left the town before full dark, walking past the last leaning cottages and into scrubland where the mine’s shadow stretched long and thin. He built the fire with methodical care, hands steady, movements precise.
The book lay in his pack.
He stared at it for a long time before taking it out.
“You did this,” he said aloud, voice raw. The fire crackled, eager.
He threw the book into the flames.
It landed among the coals and sat there.
The fire licked at its cover. Wood popped. Sparks flew. The smell of smoke thickened—but the book did not burn. The leather did not blacken. The pages did not curl.
Matthis fed the fire until it roared. He knelt close enough that the heat scorched his face. Sweat poured down his neck.
Nothing.
He could have sworn—just for a moment—that the book shivered.
He yanked it out with a stick and beat at it, over and over, until the stick snapped. He slammed it against a boulder, lifted a rock with both hands, and brought it down again and again until his arms trembled.
Not a mark.
He sagged back, breath ragged, hands shaking.
“What did you do to me?” he whispered. “I wasn’t like this. What am I?”
The pages turned.
Words appeared, calm and inevitable:
YOU HAVE ASCENDED.
YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM THE FATE THAT AWAITS ALL MEN.
YOU HAVE BEEN EXALTED BEYOND THEM.
His stomach twisted.
The book did not hurry as it continued, impressions pressing into his mind as much as ink into paper. Not all magic was wizardry. Wizards bent power through discipline and exhaustion, through flesh that failed them.
There were others.
Striga—bodies reshaped by magic until hunger itself became power.
Witches—hands that bound spells into iron, stone, bone.
Sorcerers—voices that drew strength from the world’s endless flow.
YOU ARE STRIGA.
YOU FEED UPON THE HEARTS OF MANKIND.
THE MORE YOU TAKE, THE MORE YOU BECOME.
TAKE ENOUGH, AND EVEN WIZARDS WILL KNEEL.
Matthis’s throat tightened. “I don’t want this. I didn’t mean to hurt him. It was an accident.” His voice broke. “How do I undo it?”
The words that followed felt colder. Sharper.
THE MOMENT YOU ENTERED MY LABORATORY, YOUR BODY CHANGED. PERMANENTLY.
REJECT THIS GIFT, AND DIE IN PAIN AND SHAME.
YOUR CORPSE WILL RISE GREATER THAN ANY UNDEAD YOU HAVE SEEN.
WITHOUT MY GUIDANCE, YOU WILL DESTROY MUCH—IN LIFE AND AFTER.
The tone shifted then, subtle but unmistakable.
BUT IF YOU FOLLOW ME—
YOUR RISE WILL BE GREAT.
YOU WILL FIND OTHERS. TRAIN THEM.
STRIGA. WITCHES. SORCERERS.
TOGETHER, WE WILL RETURN HUMANITY TO ITS RIGHTFUL POWER.
The fire died low beside him.
Matthis sat for a long time, staring at the book in his hands. At the unmarked cover. At the promise and the threat tangled together so tightly he could not tell where one ended and the other began.
At last, he stood.
He carried the book back toward the barracks, each step heavier than the last, knowing—deep down—that something had been agreed to, even if he had never said the words.
It felt like walking home with a devil at his side.

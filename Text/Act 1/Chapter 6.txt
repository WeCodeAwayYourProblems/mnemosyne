Something was wrong with the newest corpse. It sat there, like the others. It stank, like the others had when they still had flesh to rot. It struggled and reached for him like the others, if he stood too close. Its stripped arm bones had turned brown in the sun, as expected. But there was something wrong about it. One of their rib cages uttered a low, wooden whistle in the wind. It moaned. It should have stopped that by now. 

"You curwit!" 

An old woman wobbles her way toward the gallows. Matthis strides to her and caught her elbows. 

"Please don't get too close to them, Goody Muriel --"

She wrenched her arms away and slammed her balled fists on his chest. He lowered his hands.

"You grave-robber! You dirt-jumper!" She punctuated her screams with hard pounds to his ribs. "You took my son from his rest! You strung him up like my sweet boy was some criminal! You left him for the crows!"

His lips tightened almost imperceptibly. He squared his stance. He did not flinch. 

"How dare you take my boy from me? He's there!" She pointed at the skeleton behind him. "My Osric is there! You've stripped him! You ruined him! Nothing but bones now! How dare you!"

"Goody Muriel ..."

Matthis remembered the funeral a year ago. The dust hadn't fully settled. The sun had shone bright on the polished grave marker. 

"You marrow-sucking fiend! I'll see you hang for this, gibbet rat!" Her fists slowed. "I'll get you and see what ... I'll make you pay and then ..." 

Her words faded to mutterings. She slumped against him, and he held her tiny shoulders while she gasped and panted into his chest. Her breath slowed. She looked up. 

"Oh, young Matthis."

"Hello, Goody Muriel."

"So nice to see you this fine day." She patted his arm. "And when will you call me Aunty, like I've asked you so many times?"

"Yes, Aunty Muriel."

She pulled away from him and totted away.

"Do come by for a cuppa one of these days, won't you?" she called over shoulder. "My Osric and I will be happy to have you round."

"Yes," said Matthis around a lump in his throat, "Aunty Muriel."

He watched her wobble away until her image blurred. He blinked hard before stears could streak his face.

He turned and faced Osric's bones. They rattled when he stepped within reach. He held the wrists away from his face. The fingers scrabbled at the air inches from Matthis' cheeks. He breathed hard and forced himself to stare into those empty sockets. Osric had brown eyes once.

Two cages down the line, the wizard that should not have been able to make sound anymore moaned again. 

"What happened to you all, Osric?"

The bones clacked against the bars of their cage.

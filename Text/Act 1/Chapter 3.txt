The mine breathed.

Matthis had never thought of it that way before, but as he stepped past the last worked shaft and into a stretch the miners avoided, he felt it—air moving where it shouldn’t, a slow exhale from the stone itself. The lantern light wavered, shadows stretching and collapsing along the walls like something testing its shape.

This wasn’t part of his duty. The dead wizard miners had already been removed from the upper tunnels, their bodies bound and hauled to the guild. What remained was silence, broken only by the drip of water and the faint settling of rock.

He told himself he was only checking for signs—collapsed pockets, stray tools, anything that might indicate another body. That was the excuse. But it rang hollow even to him.

The stone changed as he went deeper. The walls grew smoother, darker, veined with mineral seams that caught the lantern light and swallowed it again. The air felt thicker, heavy in his lungs, tinged with a faint metallic tang that made his tongue prickle.

He stopped when the tunnel forked.

The left passage sloped downward, recently reinforced with timber. The right was older—no supports, the stone worn smooth by time rather than tools. The miners never went that way anymore. Too unstable. Too many accidents.

Matthis hesitated.

He thought of Bartholomew’s stone, warm with promise. Of Elspeth’s smile, held together by effort. Of the cages outside the guild, bones bleaching clean in the sun. Of the way magic lingered after death, stubborn and dangerous, refusing to fade.

*If there’s something here,* he thought, *it’ll be where no one looks anymore.*

He turned right.

The tunnel narrowed, the ceiling lowering until he had to stoop. His boots scraped against loose gravel, each step echoing too loudly. The lantern flame guttered, shrinking, then steadied again. He pressed on, heart thudding, senses sharpened by a mix of fear and anticipation.

That was when he felt it.

Not a sound. Not a sight. A pressure, low and constant, like standing near a great weight suspended overhead. The air hummed faintly, setting his teeth on edge.

He slowed.

The passage opened into a natural chamber, wider than it should have been. The walls were etched with marks that were not tool-made—curving lines, shallow grooves that caught the light at strange angles. At the center of the chamber lay a stone pedestal, half-buried in rubble.

And on it—

Matthis swallowed.

A book.

It looked wrong in a place like this. Too intact. Too deliberate. Its cover was dark and unadorned, the surface worn smooth as if by countless hands. No title. No markings. Just a faint sheen that made it stand apart from the dust and decay around it.

He stepped closer.

The pressure in the air intensified, pressing against his chest, his temples. His breath came shallow. He felt suddenly, acutely aware of himself—of his pulse, his weight, the fragile heat of life inside him.

“Just a book,” he muttered, though his voice sounded thin in the chamber.

When his fingers brushed the cover, the sensation was immediate.

The chamber vanished.

He lurched, stomach twisting, light collapsing inward. For a heartbeat—no, less than that—he felt stretched, pulled thin, as though the world were turning inside out around him.

Then stone slammed back into place.

Matthis staggered, catching himself on a cold surface. His lantern clattered to the floor, the flame flickering wildly before settling. He looked up, breath ragged.

He was no longer in the mine.

The room was vast, carved from black stone that drank the light. Tables lined the walls, cluttered with strange instruments—glass vessels clouded with residue, metal frameworks etched with sigils, bones arranged in careful, deliberate patterns. The air was dry, stale, carrying the faint scent of ash and old parchment.

This was a laboratory.

At the center of the chamber stood a dais, and upon it rested a second pedestal—this one intact, deliberate, its edges sharp with purpose. The book lay atop it, exactly where it belonged.

Matthis took a step back.

“No,” he whispered. “No, no—”

The lantern’s light swept across the walls, revealing diagrams etched directly into the stone: human forms, twisted and altered; symbols repeated again and again; notes written in a hand both precise and obsessive. Some figures were labeled. Others had been scratched out, overwritten, refined.

This was not a wizard’s workspace.

This was something older. Larger. Patient.

The door behind him was gone. No tunnel. No mine. Only smooth stone where the passage had been.

His pulse hammered in his ears.

The book’s cover creaked softly.

Matthis froze.

The surface of the page beneath the cover shifted, as though something beneath it were moving, aligning itself. He did not open it.

It opened itself.

Blank pages greeted him at first—yellowed parchment, empty and waiting. Then, slowly, faint lines emerged, like ink bleeding up from beneath the surface. Letters formed, hesitant at first, then certain.

They did not move like writing.

They moved like memory.

Matthis stared, breath shallow, as understanding pressed gently against his thoughts—not words exactly, but meaning, shaped and delivered whole.

He knew, without knowing how, that he was not meant to be here.

And that the book had been waiting anyway.

Behind him, somewhere deep in the stone, something old and vast shifted its attention.

And Matthis, standing alone in the Emperor’s abandoned laboratory, realized that whatever he had been hoping to find in the mine—

It had already found him.

Matthis turned in the square and counted the number of buildings that had appeared in the two years since he had moved here from Mills Bridge, a mill town on the north end of the valley. The place had grown like a beehive, with miner's barracks and a guildhouse, and everything spiraled from the village center. With this growth, Coalridge would be considered a township in another year. The buildings told their own stories without speaking. The stacked log or stone foundations supported tar-stained, grey wood with deep-set, small windows, dark wood shingles or turf roofs. The newer buildings, especially the hostels, felt taller and less dusty, with timber frames and flatter roofing beside blackened stone with slanted peaks.
The Oak and Ember pub felt older than the other buildings in the square. The stone foundation grew out of the ground. The wood had a dark, worn look, as though it had survived lifetimes of winter. With wide doors, low beams, the smell of boiled grain and woodsmoke, and the warm flicker of firelight in the blurry window, it felt like a home.
The chimney above the Oak and Ember puffed a gravy-colored film over the square. The Pit pounded in Matthis' head, but he didn't move. He paused with his hand on the latch. With the stillness of night and muffled through the door, the swishes of a skirt and the soft pads of a gentle step eased the pound in his head. He stepped inside.
The hearth was large enough for two full grown men to sleep in it. Two iron pot cranes built into either side of the hearth supported deep pots that hung over a fire. The flames threatened to roar out of control without a careful eye. Elspeth used a long ladle wrapped in her apron to stir the contents of one pot, her head turned away from the fire's heat, reddish curls wrapped by a kerchief above her neck, hand on one hip. 
Matthis moved inside and closed the door. The long tables sported knife scars and burns that had been buffed and oiled, but no food stains. The warm hall felt easy, comforting. Matthis stood, back stiff. He didn't sit. 
Elspeth didn't even look back. Eyes on the pot, she spoke as though continuing a conversation they had already started. "You look thin." She tapped the edge of the pot with the ladle and moved to stir the second pot. "Sit."
"I know it's early --"
"Sit," she repeated and nudged a bench with her foot. Her green eyes smiled at him over her shoulder. She pushed back shoulder-length curls that had slipped around her kerchief.
He eased himself into a bench at the far corner, far away from the fire, without any noise. Elspeth poked the fire, which calmed. The angry boil in the pots lowered to a cheeful bubble. She hung the ladle on a hook set into the mantle and whisked into the kitchen. She touched a table and a bench with a corner of her apron. Nothing here was expensive, but it somehow sparkled, like quartz, after she touched it. 
She returned with a plate and set it in front of him. Thick bread, dark and dense, the crust split where it had risen, overstuffed with richness. A wedge of cheese beside it, pale and crumbly, still sweated. She sat across from him.
"Eat." She smiled.
Steam ghosted from the bread's center when he broke it, with the smell of grain, seeds, nuts, herbs, and something else, something calm and strong, like care. He took a bite. 
The bread was heavy, but in a way that filled and warmed him, and when he swallowed, he felt it settle, solid and sure, a steady brace. The cheese followed, sharp and clean. He hadn't realized how hungry he felt, especially so late at night, or so early in the morning. He ate more quickly than he meant to, and swallowed, embarrassed.
Elspeth leaned against the table on her elbows. She watched without staring.
"You're not here for breakfast," she said.
"No," he admitted.
She nodded, as though she knew why he was there all along. "Have another piece, then." 
She broke the loaf and handed it to him. "Have the lot. You'll need it. Where you're going."
"You don't have to --"
"I do," she said. "For the same reason you do."
He stared then. "And what reason is that?"
"So things don't fall apart all at once."
She pushed off the table and returned to the kitchen before he could reply. 
When he had finished eating, he stood. Sounds from the kitchen told him Elspeth was hard at work. He left a few coins under his plate. He turned to leave.
"Matthis." Elspeth emerged from the kitchen with flour on her hands. "It's been a year. Since you've been back inside."
He stopped and looked at her.
"Elspeth."
She brushed her hands on her apron. "Yes?"
He gestured at the plate. "Thank you."
She smiled, not a wide, toothy smile. Just enough. "Come back afterward," she said. "You'll want supper."
After.
He stepped back out into the street. Somewhere, a crow quarked.
He walked past the graveyard on the hill above the square. Wooden markers leaned at odd angles and stone ones bore names carved too hastily. Twenty-two graves from the cave-in. Seventeen quiet forever. Five had not stayed quiet.
The smell was their only warning. Then the way the ground had shifted, opened outward, like when a bloated carcass bursts. It had taken a week for the wizards to claw their way back into the world. The others had stayed buried. Other wizards had died since then. Accident. Illness. Exhaustion. Some rose. Some didn't.
He faced the direction of the Pit, eyes wide against the blackness. Clouds had gathered overhead and blocked out the stars. But he could almost taste the Pit, the way it smelled, the mustiness. He found the road and followed as it narrowed, climbed, and gave way to packed earth and old rails. 
The Coalridge Pit opened its maw before him. The darkness inside swallowed everything. He could feel the mine inhale, try to suck him in. He pictured the day of the disaster, when dust poured out of the Pit like black smoke. When nature failed, or rebelled, and wizards rose. 
His legs stopped shaking. He checked the lamp at his belt. The magic stone ignited with a cold orange light unlike Elspeth's fire at the Oak and Ember. He adjusted his satchel. 
The mine closed around him for the first time since the disaster. Matthis let it and walked toward answers that did not want to be found.

The street smelled of wet stone and iron. Miners, street vendors, and children who had no place to be anywhere other than here moved past him, shoulders brushing, voices low and clipped. Matthis noticed everything now: the heat rising from a man’s neck, the faint tremor in a woman’s hands as she balanced her basket of herbs, the tension in a boy who tried to hide a bruise on his cheek.

He stopped at the corner where a cart had spilled, a dozen empty barrels rolling loose. Without thinking, he shifted, moving to intercept them. His hands brushed the wood as it threatened to roll into the street. A surge of something like warmth slid through him—the faint echo of the energy the humans carried. Not visible, not overt, but there.

He froze. The sensation died almost as quickly as it had come, leaving his stomach hollow. The same heat, the same pull, was everywhere. People were moving, living, talking, breathing—and he could feel it all, almost tangibly.

*It’s supposed to be hunger,* he thought. *I… I’m not supposed to feel this like this.*

He kept moving, hands in his pockets, head down, but he couldn’t stop noticing. When someone brushed past him too closely, he felt a spark. A tug in his chest that made him step back. Every time he tried to ignore it, the sensation pressed harder.

By the time he reached the small square near the fountain, he was shaking. It wasn’t fear. Not exactly. It was *awareness*. A constant pull toward everyone, a whisper of what they carried inside them. And it didn’t fade.

He ducked into the shade of the market stalls, trying to hide, to catch his breath. The book was heavy in his bag, closed and silent, but he knew it was waiting. Like the mine, like the shard, it had not finished with him.

A thought pressed into him—not words, not speech, but something deeper: *you can take it. You can take it and survive.*

He jumped. The words weren’t on the page; they weren’t spoken aloud. They were inside his mind, insistent, sharp, as if drawn from the marrow of the world itself.

Matthis shook his head. *No. No, that’s wrong.*

But the whisper didn’t stop. *It is not wrong. Only inefficient. You can take what they give. You can hold it, make it yours, and they will not suffer if you are careful.*

The heat of the crowd pressed closer. He could feel it now, not just the faint glow of life around them, but the intensity—desire, longing, hunger in all its shapes. The book’s suggestion threaded through the sensation, drawing it into clarity.

*They cannot give it to you unwillingly. Consent matters. But the stronger it is, the more it flows. And the more you will grow.*

Matthis stumbled back against the wall of a stall. His hands were shaking. The words in his head were calm, deliberate, like a hand coaxing him into a pool of water he could sense was deep and cold.

*Practice, and it will come naturally. You will not take what you do not have permission to take. They will not suffer if you do it correctly.*

He clenched his fists. The thought made the air feel heavier, as if the space around him had thickened with attention. He could feel the people around him even when they weren’t looking at him. Their warmth, their tension, the small sparks that nobody else noticed—it all pulsed beneath his skin.

He pressed his hands to his ears. *Stop. Stop. I’m not doing this.*

But the whisper, patient and unyielding, persisted. *Do not fear it. You are learning. You are safe. You are growing.*

Matthis staggered toward the fountain, splashing cold water onto his face. The pull subsided a little, leaving a faint ringing in his skull. He shivered, teeth chattering, and leaned against the stone.

Something was different. He could feel it in the way he noticed people, the way their energy touched him, the way the book’s words had threaded themselves into his thoughts without his permission. He had crossed a threshold, though he did not yet understand it.

By the time he left the square, the whisper had quieted, but the sensation remained. A subtle vibration under his skin. A warning, or a promise, he could not tell.

He did not know it yet, but when he slept that night, the shard would hum faintly beneath his pillow, and the book would wait, patient, for the moment when he was ready to take the first step into what it called *power*.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, a small, uneasy thought began to grow: *I am not the same as I was this morning.*

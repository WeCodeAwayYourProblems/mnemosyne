The dawn broke gray and thin over the mining town, washing the frost in a dull light that made the stones look older than they were. Matthis sat on the edge of the guild yard, knees pulled up, staring at the dull shimmer of the ash piles where the last of the undead had burned. His fingers ached from yesterday’s labor, but it was a different kind of ache than before—a gnawing, hollow guilt. He could not stop thinking about Elspeth. The brief warmth of her lips pressed against his cheek haunted him, but more than that haunted him was the knowledge of what he *almost did*.
He blamed himself. Not the book, not the hunger. *He* had let it happen.
Even so, life demanded its work. The mine was producing again, and the undead were still a constant hazard, though the guild’s new ash method had given them hope. Matthis noticed small changes in the men he worked alongside: the way Bartholomew’s hands moved faster on the stone, how the younger miners could swing axes more efficiently than he’d thought possible. Instinctively, he reached out with the faint echo of influence, curious what it would do.
The results were astonishing. A single nod from him, a quiet gesture toward the pickaxe, and the boy’s movements sharpened, almost unnaturally precise. Walls that had seemed stubborn yielded as if they recognized the miner’s will. Matthis’s chest tightened at the sensation, part thrill, part unease. The book had taught him the mechanics of dominion—COMPEL. TAKE. DRAW FROM THEIR ENERGY. CONTROL—but he had not done so consciously. He had only *nudged*. And yet, the results were beyond what the book had promised.
That evening, he let himself sit on a bench near the square, watching the miners return with new loads. The book flopped out of his bag, open, as if drawn by the question forming in his mind.
What is happening? he asked silently, and the book’s words scrawled across the page:
YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. YOUR INFLUENCE IS SOFT, UNSTRUCTURED. YOU COULD DOMINATE THEM FULLY. DRAW OUT THEIR LIVES AND POWER. CEASE TO WASTE YOUR GIFT.
Matthis clenched his fists. “I am not doing it wrong,” he whispered to himself. “I’m… protecting them.”
The next day, he found another opportunity to test both methods. A miner named Godric, unremarkable in demeanor and quiet in speech, had been struggling with a section of hardened wall. Matthis approached him carefully, still wary of the book’s influence.
“Godric,” he said quietly, “try to… feel the stone. Not just hit it.”
Godric frowned, glancing at him skeptically. Matthis crouched beside him, placing a hand over the boy’s shoulder. He tried the book’s method, the mechanics of dominion, imagining the flow of magic through Godric’s body and into the pickaxe. He felt the boy tense instinctively but continued, guiding him gently.
“Feel it moving from the stone into you,” he murmured, voice soft. “And then from you, into the pickaxe. Let it… work with you, not against you.”
The effect was subtle at first. Godric’s movements were smoother, the axe cutting with a slight shimmer of light as if it obeyed him. Then the wall cracked, a clean slice along its hardened surface. Matthis stepped back, heart thumping. The book’s words flopped open again, but he ignored them. THIS WAS DONE WITHOUT COMMAND. SET ASIDE YOUR WEAKNESS. TAKE COMMAND.
Later, he heard screams. A crowd had gathered near one of the miners’ barracks. Matthis ran, heart hammering, and found a young girl wailing amid a splatter of blood and shattered stone. The smell of copper filled the air. Something had gone terribly wrong. He could feel the pulse of magic radiating from her, chaotic, wild, jagged.
The book flopped out as if responding to his gaze. Matthis did not ask aloud, but the words appeared:
SHE IS A WARLOCK. UNTRAINED. UNCONTROLLED. EVERY TOUCH, EVERY MOTION, IS A CURSE. SHE WILL KILL WITHOUT GUIDANCE. YOU MUST TAKE DOMINION OVER HER, OR SHE WILL UNDO ALL AROUND HER.
The girl shrieked, thrashing, eyes wide with terror. Matthis knelt at a careful distance, trying to feel her emotions, her fear, the sparks of her raw power. She was a living hazard, unstable, capable of cursing the entire town. But she was also a child.
Matthis’s stomach twisted. He thought of Elspeth. He thought of the miners, of Bartholomew. And he thought of himself, and the power surging in him, the raw, terrible gift the book had given him.
If he tried to calm her with influence—gently, without compulsion—he might fail. People could die. But if he obeyed the book’s instructions, exerted dominion, forced her to submit to his will, he would be violating every moral instinct he had, treating a child like a tool, feeding on the power she had no way to control.
He stepped back, torn, heart hammering. The book flopped again at his feet, open, blank… then slowly, deliberately, letters began to crawl across the page:
MAKE A DECISION. YOUR CHOICE OF INFLUENCE IS WEAK. DOMINATE OR WATCH THIS CHILD DESTROY HERSELF AND EVERYTHING AROUND HER. CHOOSE WISELY.
Matthis closed his eyes, breathing deep. A quiet storm of guilt, fear, and hunger churned inside him. One choice would save lives at the cost of his conscience. The other preserved his morality but risked death and destruction.
The night pressed in around him, the lanterns flickering against the gray stones. Somewhere behind him, the town slept, unaware of the danger—unaware of the terrible weight of choice now resting entirely in one man’s hands.
Matthis opened his eyes, trembling. The warlock girl screamed again.
And he knew that he had to act.

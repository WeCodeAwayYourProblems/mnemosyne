The night had pressed down on the town like wet wool. The lanterns along the square flickered, their light thin and uncertain, casting long shadows across frost-crusted stones. Matthis sat on a low wall near the fountain, knees drawn, hands clasped over them, trying to ignore the hollowness gnawing at his chest.

He’d been restless all evening, muscles twitching, heart racing despite exhaustion. It had started subtle—a jitter in his hands, the faint tremor in his jaw—but now it was insistent, unrelenting. Even Bartholomew had noticed when he passed by with a bundle of tools for the crematorium.

“You look… off, Matthis,” the wizard had said, voice cautious. “You’ve barely eaten today, haven’t you? And your strength… it’s not steady.”

“I’m fine,” Matthis murmured, forcing a smile, though it felt empty, hollow.

The words *must feed* appeared suddenly, stark and insistent in his mind, as if the book had heard his every hesitation.

*You haven’t since the wizard in the cave. Do it. Now.*

Matthis’s stomach clenched. He clenched his fists in the dark, ashamed, terrified, yet desperate. He had ignored the book for days, hoping the subtle influence and his own reserve would carry him. But now, weakness crawled into his limbs, and his chest ached.

A soft shuffle behind him made him turn. Elspeth had arrived, carrying a small plate wrapped in cloth. She sat down beside him without asking, hands steady despite the cold.

“I thought you might be hungry,” she said, voice casual, warm. “It’s fresh from the oven. Just the loaf you like—well, mostly.” She brushed the crumbs from her apron and offered the plate.

Matthis studied it. He could feel it before he tasted it—the faint, familiar tremor of magic in her hands, the careful layering of attention, worry, and affection. Her emotions pooled around the bread like warm water. Normally, such things would comfort a person. Normally, it would satiate a man.

Not him. Not anymore.

“I… thank you,” he said quietly, taking the cloth and setting it on his lap. He tried to meet her eyes, but the hunger behind his gaze was too raw, too desperate.

“Are you well?” she asked again, tilting her head, suspicion underlaid with concern.

“Yes,” he said, forcing it. “Just… tired, I think.”

She leaned closer to inspect him, and he felt it—the subtle undercurrent that the book had taught him to sense, the latent potential locked within another human. He could feel it in her pulse, the slight flush on her cheeks, the warmth of her breath. Not arousal now, not desire—but the *possibility* of it, dormant, waiting, like embers under ash.

Matthis’s body twitched instinctively. Just a little—testing, not touching, just a flicker of magic probing the edges of what he could reach.

The response was immediate. Elspeth’s eyes widened. She leaned in suddenly, lips pressing to his with a breathless urgency. His own breath caught; instinctively, he felt the flow of life surge through him, stronger than anything he had drawn from the wizard miner.

He froze, startled, feeling the sudden, potent tide of her vitality. Then, horror struck him—the same fear that had haunted the cave—the thought of taking too much. He let go immediately, breaking the invisible siphon, stepping back.

Elspeth pulled away, chest heaving, hands pressed to her face. “I—I…” Her voice broke. “It’s… my fault. I shouldn’t—”

“Stop,” Matthis said urgently, reaching toward her. “No. It’s not you. It’s not your fault.”

She shook her head, tears glinting in the lantern light. “I—I didn’t mean—”

“I know,” he said, voice low, tight with guilt. “It’s… me. I—”

Before he could finish, she rose and fled, back toward the bakery, face buried in her hands. The cold night air swallowed her small figure. Matthis remained still, chest heaving, staring after her.

The book landed on his lap with a soft thump, open and blank. Then the words scrawled themselves in a slow, deliberate hand:

*Well done. You have embraced your nature. You have chosen a subject of great potential. Next time, it will be easier.*

Matthis’s hands shook. “No,” he muttered, throwing the book with all his strength into the air.

It arced over the square, silhouetted against the moon, spinning like a bird caught in a storm. But the moment it descended, it landed neatly at his feet, open, waiting.

*Excellent. She is yours to guide. A naturally talented witch, capable of great things. Do not waste her potential.*

Matthis staggered back, chest heaving. The night pressed in, dark and silent, and he sank to the stones, burying his face in his hands.

“Why,” he whispered, “did this happen?”

The book remained, calm, patient, omnipresent. And for the first time, Matthis understood the scale of what he was up against: his own hunger, his own nature, and the subtle tyranny of influence he now wielded.

He would have to learn restraint, he would have to learn to master it—but not tonight. Tonight, the guilt and the thrill of power churned in his veins, tangled and inseparable, like fire and smoke in the winter air.

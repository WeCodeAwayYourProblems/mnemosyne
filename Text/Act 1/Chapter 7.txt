Matthis left the book in his bunk.

That was the first thing he did when morning came—if morning was the right word for a time that arrived without sleep. He sat on the edge of the narrow cot, boots on the floor, hands resting on his knees, staring at the leather-bound thing as if it might move on its own.

It didn’t.

He wrapped it in a scrap of sacking and shoved it beneath the straw mattress. The boards creaked when he stood. The barracks smelled of sweat, old iron, and damp wool. Men were already moving outside. Chains rattled. Someone coughed wetly.

He went out without looking back.

The yard beyond the guild house was already awake. The cages stood in their usual line—iron ribs open to the air, sunk into the hard-packed earth. Inside them, bones lay tangled and pale, some clotted still with scraps of darkening flesh. A few stirred when he passed. Not violently. Just a restless clatter, like dice shaken in a cup.

Someone said his name.

He turned. The speaker stopped short, as if surprised by how quickly Matthis had moved.

“Didn’t hear you come up,” the man said, forcing a grin. “You—uh—you’re quick today.”

Matthis shrugged and took the offered chain. His hands closed around the links easily. Too easily. He lifted, set the weight, secured the latch. The motion felt smooth, practiced, *right* in a way work never had before.

Eyes followed him. Not hostile. Curious. A little awed.

He finished early. No one asked him to stay.

By midmorning, the town had begun to feel small.

He walked the main way past the taverns—their doors open though the sun was barely up, laughter already sharp inside. Past the washerwomen bent over steaming tubs. Past men who paused mid-sentence when they saw him, then nodded as if to someone important.

It was easier to breathe when he reached the bakery.

The heat rolled out when the door opened. Yeast and sugar. Flour dusted the air like pale smoke. Elspeth stood behind the counter with her sleeves rolled and her hair tied back in a way that never quite held. She was laughing at something a child had said, bending down to listen as if it mattered.

It did matter.

She looked up and saw him. Her smile didn’t change.

“Morning,” she said, like it was any other day.

“Morning,” he answered, and felt the word settle into him.

She slid a loaf across the counter to a waiting woman, then leaned her elbows down and lowered her voice. “You look like you haven’t slept.”

“I haven’t.”

“Well,” she said, considering him, “you’re walking like you’ve borrowed someone else’s legs.”

He huffed a quiet laugh and shook his head. “People keep staring.”

She glanced toward the door, where a man had paused just long enough to pretend he wasn’t looking. “You really don’t know?”

“Know what?”

She tilted her head. “After you came out of that mine with a wizard slung across your shoulder like a sack of grain… you weren’t the same.”

He felt heat rise in his face. “I just did my job.”

“No,” she said gently. “It felt like a story. Like something old stepping out of the dark.”

“That’s not—” He stopped. The words caught. “I’m not special.”

Her eyes softened. “You always were.”

The way she said it—quiet, certain—unsettled him more than the stares had. He looked down at his hands, flexed them once, as if checking they were still his.

“I don’t want to be,” he said.

She stepped around the counter before he could react and kissed his cheek. Quick. Warm. Familiar. Her fingers brushed his arm as she pulled back, and there was no hesitation in her touch.

“Then don’t be,” she said. “Just be you.”

She turned back to her work like nothing momentous had happened.

Matthis left with his heart pounding and the taste of ash in his mouth. Halfway down the street, he stopped and pressed his palm against his cheek as if the warmth might still be there.

*Did I make her do that?*

The thought followed him all the way back to the barracks.

Night came. Or something like it. He lay on his cot staring at the ceiling beams, listening to breathing, to muttered dreams, to the soft clink of bone outside as something shifted in a cage.

At last, he dragged the book free.

It fell open on its own.

**YOU WONDER IF SHE IS YOURS.**

“No,” he said aloud. “I don’t.”

**SHE WOULD BE SUITABLE.**

His stomach turned. “I won’t.”

The page shifted.

**DOMINION NEED NOT BE SUDDEN.**
**LOYALTY GROWS WHEN TAKEN A LITTLE AT A TIME.**

“That’s not loyalty,” he snapped.

**THEY ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.**
**THEY SIMPLY RESPOND TO YOU.**
**THE RESPONSE COULD BE STRONGER.**

He shut the book hard enough to sting his fingers.

The next day, he didn’t open it.

He worked. He hauled chains. He helped lift the newly dead wizard into a cage and fastened it shut. This one moved more than the others—flesh still clinging, fingers twitching as if remembering tools. When Matthis stepped closer, even the bleached bones in neighboring cages rattled faintly, like they were listening.

He stepped back, unsettled.

*Why do we do this at all?* he wondered. *Why does it matter?*

The book slid from his bag and opened at his feet.

**MAGIC FLOWS IN ALL THINGS.**
**I CALL IT THE CURRENT.**
**WHEN IT STAGNATES IN THE DEAD, THEY RISE.**
**TAKE IT FROM THEM, OR BURN THEM TO ASH.**
**LEAVE NOTHING.**

Matthis stared down at the words, then at the cages, at the restless bones, at the wizard who had once laughed underground and now moaned without knowing why.

He closed the book and walked away from it.

For the rest of the day, it stayed where he left it.

Waiting.

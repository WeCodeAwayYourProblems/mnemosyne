The candlelight trembled against the walls, but Matthis didn’t notice. He sat cross-legged on the floor, the book open before him, and his hands hovered over the pages as though touching them might draw forth some hidden pulse.

The letters writhed and reshaped themselves, curling into forms that seemed almost alive. For the first time, Mnemosyne’s words weren’t only in his mind—they pressed against his senses, nudging him, pulling him.

*You have the sight now,* the book said. *Not for magic. Not yet. For what flows between them. Feel it.*

Matthis frowned. *Feel it?*

*The life around you. The heat, the tension, the joy, the fear. All of it.*

He tried to push the thought aside, but the faint pull was irresistible. He focused on the lantern’s light, on the walls, then, almost by accident, on himself. On the faint, subtle pulses of feeling that he hadn’t noticed before—moments of hope, fear, desire in the world around him.

*Reach. Take. Harness it.*

It was not hunger—not like the miner’s thirst or the gnawing ache of a night without sleep. It was subtler, a warmth in his chest that spread outward when he allowed himself to touch it. He touched it, and a small rush of strength surged through him. His fingers felt quicker, his muscles taut and alive, and he laughed quietly, startled by the feeling.

*Again,* Mnemosyne whispered inside his mind. *More. You may take it. It belongs to those who give it willingly and those who cannot resist.*

Matthis hesitated. The book was not cruel. Not yet. But the temptation—the thrill of it—made his heart beat faster. He focused on a memory: the baker’s boy, fumbling with a sack of flour, frustrated and anxious. He allowed himself to reach out, gently, unseen, and draw the tension. The boy flinched faintly, the sensation barely noticeable, but Matthis felt it: the rush of control, of strength, of the world bending slightly to him.

He exhaled. *I could… do this anywhere.*

*Yes.* The letters on the page glimmered, affirming him. *You need nothing. Not food. Not water. Not sleep. The world provides. All that you need is in what they carry.*

He leaned back, astonished. The truth of it wrapped around him like a cloak: endless energy, endless possibility. He could wander the streets all night, through markets, lanes, alleys, and find more. Learn more. Grow stronger.

*And you may lie. You may deceive. You may use what you must. All is permitted to achieve what you deserve.*

Matthis’ stomach twisted, the first inkling of a moral hesitation—but it was brief. The surge of possibility drowned it. If the world itself was offering him power, why should he hesitate?

*Observe them. Learn them. Guide them. Use them. You will know when to touch, when to pull, when to let flow. Nothing else matters.*

He felt the air around him pulse with potential. The market, the streets, the houses—even his own small room—were full of currents he had never noticed. Emotions, subtle and hidden, waiting to be drawn into him. And he could. He could take it all, little by little, and nothing would stand in his way.

*Do not doubt. Do not question. Strength belongs to those who reach.*

Matthis’ hand brushed the page, and a thrill coursed through him. He felt it in his muscles, in his breath, in the sudden alertness that left him dizzy with energy. He could feel the pull even now, without reaching out. The book’s words shaped him, guided him, opened a path that he had never dreamed of.

He smiled, a faint, dark smile. The night stretched before him, full of hidden currents, full of people who carried what he needed. He could walk among them, feed, grow, and never stop.

*Do you understand, learner?*

*Yes.* He whispered the word, not fully realizing the weight it carried. *I understand.*

And for the first time, Matthis knew he did not need sleep. He did not need food. He did not need water. Not as long as he could feed on the world. Not as long as Mnemosyne guided him.

The book shifted, its letters curling into new shapes, promising lessons, discoveries, and paths. The allure of more—the hidden, dangerous knowledge of witches, warlocks, striga—tugged at him.

*And soon,* it seemed to whisper, *you will see that the world is far larger than you imagined.*

Matthis leaned forward, eager, trembling, and opened the next page.

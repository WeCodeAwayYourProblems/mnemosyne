The room smelled of damp stone and soot. Matthis had rented it from a hostel tucked behind the main street, a narrow building with uneven floorboards and a view only of the alley below. A lantern sputtered in the corner, casting shadows that clung to the walls. He sat on the edge of the cot, the book open on his lap, pages blank—or so it seemed.

*Something’s wrong with me,* he muttered aloud. The words felt strange on his tongue.

A flicker of movement caught his eye. The letters shifted faintly, curling into forms that seemed to respond to his gaze.

*Feed.*

That was all. One word. Simple. Nothing more.

He frowned, shivering. “Feed?”

The letters held, refusing elaboration. He closed the book and lay back, trying to force himself to sleep. The room smelled faintly of wet stone and candle smoke, but sleep wouldn’t come. He turned the word over in his mind, testing it, rolling it across his thoughts like a stone in a pocket.

The next morning, he walked to the mines before dawn. The miners were already gathering, their faces streaked with soot and exhaustion. Matthis noticed first something subtle: the tension in their shoulders, the weariness that clung to every movement. And then he noticed something else.

A faint tug. Not hunger, not desire, but a sense of what they carried inside them. Anxiety, frustration, hope. It pooled at the edges of their awareness, and when he allowed himself to touch it, even unconsciously, he felt… lighter. Stronger.

“Matthis,” a fellow miner said as they hefted a rock-laden cart, “you’re moving faster than yesterday. You feeling all right?”

“I… I think so,” he said, trying to sound casual, though a shiver ran through him.

Over the next day, the effect grew. He carried heavier loads, climbed shafts faster, and when others paused to catch their breath, he felt almost nothing. At night, when he returned to the hostel, he lay awake thinking of the book, the single word that had entered his mind: *feed.*

By the third day, he began to notice more than just energy. Emotions were almost tactile now: the miner’s frustration like hot metal under his fingers, the cook’s fatigue like a shadow pressing on his chest. He did not reach for it consciously; it flowed into him, subtle, unnoticed, until he felt the power humming inside him, coiled and alive.

“You’re… different,” one of the older miners said during lunch, eyeing his effortless strength as he hefted supplies. “Faster than you’ve ever been. Careful, boy. Don’t burn yourself out.”

“I’m fine,” Matthis said, smiling, but the warmth in his chest told a different story. He didn’t need rest, didn’t need food or water. He felt alive, alert, and he knew why, though he did not yet speak it aloud.

The nights became restless. On the fourth evening, he found himself pacing the narrow hallway of the hostel, the smell of damp wood and oil pressing in, shadows long and dark along the walls. The pull in his chest grew insistent, urgent, gnawing.

*Take it. Take it now.*

The book never explained why. It never promised anything beyond the word. But instinctively, he reached out—almost without thinking. He felt the emotions around him: the hostel clerk counting coins, the cook tending the oven, the faint worry of a child outside a window. He allowed the warmth, the tension, the small pulses to flow into him.

And it worked.

Strength flooded his muscles. His breath came easily, his mind sharpened. His heart hammered, and sweat ran down his back, but he felt… satisfied. Lighter. Powerful.

*Feed.*

The word lingered in his mind long after the last tendrils of energy settled. Matthis sank onto his cot, sweating, but alive in a way he had never known. The room smelled of damp stone and old wood, and he let the shadows wrap around him as he considered the possibilities.

The world was full of people. Full of energy. Full of currents waiting to be drawn. And he now knew the secret: he could take it, and it would sustain him.

Sleep, food, drink—nothing else mattered. Only the energy of those around him.

And he would find it.

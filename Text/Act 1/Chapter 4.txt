The sound of his feet echoed too long. The darkness ahead swelled too close. The darkness behind closed too quickly. He was being swallowed.
The hollow orange light of his lantern barely touched the walls, turning them a burnt black. But he remembered these passages. Down the first shaft, they had changed the ladder from wood to metal and anchored it into the stone. In Old Bed, the dug out passage was still too low to stand upright but widened out to a chamber the width and length of the village square. Along Left Fork, the tunnel still widened into a natural cave that had long been stripped of its stalagmites and stalactites. But mineral water still carved a gnarled scar down one wall of the tunnel and slid into a culvert gored into the rock by magic. 
Magic always left something else. Something unintended. The magic to make the culvert had turned one patch of wall into a squishy, flesh-colored bulb the size of a fist. It pulsed, soundless and bloodless. Knives and pickaxes and earth magic could not extricate or cut it. Matthis raised his hand and held it there. He reached out a finger. And touched it. It was warm. The pulse felt like a heartbeat. He wished he hadn't touched it.
He continued on. Past the dug out seams along Left Fork, which led nowhere. Past an air shaft made by magic to the surface. The unintended effect of that magic had turned a stretch of wall underneath the air shaft into a strange crystal. A crystal that never stopped growing. At least, not for the first week after the magic was cast. Matthis touched the spot where it had formed. He remembered the finger-length bits of crystal that had showered from it like a waterfall of rock. They had kept a bucket underneath it to keep the miners from tripping on the useless minerals, which had turned out to be bits of brittle granite that broke or turned to dust between the fingers.
The mine kept its own time. Thirty minutes or three hours could have passed when Matthis exited the Left Fork and emerged into a widened area. The area where the cave-in had occurred. It used to be a tunnel that connected to a network of coal seams. But they had collapsed under their own weight.
He had expected something to be left behind. He remembered the piles of rubble, the gigantic boulders, the endless soil and gravel everywhere, the dust that never settled. The suffocation. Now, the piles were gone. They left nothing but smooth stone behind. 
He knelt at the spot where he had helped pull out one of the victims. The ceiling felt higher now. He remembered crouching under a spot in the ceiling above him. The man had been covered in black dust, unrecognizable as human. He had lain trapped and bleeding for hours under the debris. Hours. The blood had congealed on his face and mixed with the dust. That blackness had never come off him. Even after death. 
Matthis stood and inspected the walls. He took the lantern off his belt and investigated the rock with his hands. When magic burst from wizards, the unintended effect could be anything. He crawled into a seam that looked newer, as though it still had coal to give. He had once seen flowers sprout out of rock and wither to dust at a wizard's feet during magical excavation. He covered his mouth and nose with a kerchief he pulled from his satchel and felt around the little shelf. He moved on to the next. And the next. And the next. 
Black from hair roots to heels, he stood in the middle of the chamber. He pulled down his kerchief and shook it out. He tied his lantern back onto his belt. He dusted off his arms. He scratched dust out of his ears. If he turned around, he would go back. If he turned left, he would go on. He looked at the ceiling. He looked at the floor. Dust fell from his hair. This was just an accident. That's all it was. 
He knelt again for a moment. At the spot where the man had died. Where so many had died. He placed a hand on the rock and closed his eyes. 
He stood. 
He turned left.

The shallow tunnel smelled like earth. The support beams grew closer together, and some places were shored up with timber reinforced with mortar and clay. He passed an air shaft that revealed the surface to be only about twenty feet above him. He could see pink morning light at the end of it.
The tunnel ended in an abrupt downward shaft. He did not remember this one, but he could see the bottom at the very end of his lamp light. Some shafts had landings, a short tunnel with an air shaft, another downward shaft, and then shelves. This felt familiar. 
He turned on the landing and moved along the tunnel. But when he turned, he didn't see another shaft. It wasn't another chamber either.
It was impossible.
Shocked by its shear scale, he marveled. He stepped inside a chamber large enough to fit the entire village. Perhaps more. More than fifty feet above him at even intervals, windows lined the entire room, which filled it with white light. Impossible. He was underground. He had seen the morning light earlier. The sky was pink and turning orange. He had never seen light like this.
The room didn't have four walls. It was somehow circular, or an oval shape. He had never fathomed architecture like that, not even underground. 
The floor and walls were made of some sort of white material that reminded him of pale granite. He had heard of marble before, but had never seen it. He knelt and touched the floor. Dirt and coal dust fell off him. He looked behind him and saw his trail of dirt and dust. He uttered a nervous sound like a laugh and stopped immediately. The sound did not travel beyond the space immediately around him. No echo. His voice simply vanished.
Tables lined the circular, smooth wall, each holding a variety of books and instruments. Some books lay open. Some instruments moved. But sound did not travel here, so he couldn't tell if the instruments made noise. The center of the chamber was bare, except for a small wooden table. When he looked at the windows on the opposite side of the room, hundreds of feet away, perhaps further, and tried to compare their distance against his distance from the center of the room, somehow the center seemed further away. 
He walked toward the center of the room. It arrived sooner than he thought it should. He didn't count his steps.

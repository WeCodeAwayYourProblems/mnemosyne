Matthis first saw her in the early morning haze, where the streets ran red with dust and coal, and the market smells were still sharp with smoke. She was bent over a crate of herbs, fingers brushing leaves that smelled of thyme and bitter earth, her hair tied back with a strip of linen that frayed at the edges.

He didn’t approach. He didn’t need to. He could feel her presence from across the square—steady, careful, deliberate. The sort of focus that made the world shrink around her, so that only what mattered had weight.

He watched her straighten and shake out her apron, sending a small cloud of dust into the air. Her shoulders relaxed, and a tiny laugh escaped her lips at something he couldn’t hear. That laugh, the tremor in it, set something alive inside him. Not hunger. Not need. Just attention.

By the next day, he had worked his way to a casual greeting.

“Morning,” he said, trying to sound ordinary.

“Morning,” she said back, not pausing in her work, but the faint lift of her eyes caught him. Recognition. Not surprise, but acknowledgment.

It became a rhythm. He would cross paths with her in the market. She would let him help carry crates or brush herbs out of the way. He found himself watching small gestures: the way she pinched the stems, the way her fingers trembled after pulling too hard, the way she laughed when a child knocked over a basket. She had a careful patience that he recognized from the mine—the way you learn to wait for stone to break rather than forcing it.

He started helping more than necessary. Holding open doors. Stepping in to catch falling fruit. Carrying bundles she didn’t ask him to carry. Not because he wanted her to notice—he wanted to feel the rhythm of her day, the small pulses of life that had weight, shape, and texture.

It was easy to forget the book was in his bag.

But it wasn’t gone. The faint pull was there, always, like a finger brushing against the back of his mind, noting things he did not yet understand. The book’s impressions were subtle, almost gentle, but persistent: *observe what flows, notice what rises, note what is held close.*

And he did.

He noticed the way she spoke softly to the children in the square. How her back stiffened when a man barged past. The quiet, precise gestures she made as she weighed herbs, folded linens, counted coins. He followed her rhythm without thought, almost without noticing.

It was easier than he would have guessed to care for her small, daily motions.

The first night he slept near the market, he replayed it in his mind: the brush of her fingers over leaves, the warmth in her laugh, the faint tremor of exertion in her hands. Nothing more. Nothing less.

He didn’t know it yet, but the book was watching too. Waiting. Whispering without words, nudging him toward what it called *rightness*. The way it nudged wasn’t clear, and it had not yet intruded, but he would feel it later.

For now, all that mattered was the trust he had earned—or imagined. The shared rhythm of small, unspoken agreements.

The trust would be shattered before he even realized it existed.

But that was a problem for another day.

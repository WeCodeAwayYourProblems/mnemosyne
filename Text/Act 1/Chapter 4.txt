Time did not behave properly in the chamber.
Matthis became aware of that first by his breathing. It never quite settled into a rhythm. Each breath felt borrowed, as though the air itself were indifferent to whether he used it or not. The lantern still burned, but its flame gave no comfort here. Light fell and was swallowed, leaving the edges of things uncertain.
He stood where he was for a long time.
The book lay open on the pedestal, its pages still. Blank again. As if nothing had happened at all.
“What’s wrong with me?” he asked the room.
The words surprised him. He hadn’t planned to speak. They had simply risen, heavy and unsteady, like something dislodged from deep inside his chest.
The chamber did not answer.
His skin prickled. The pressure he had felt before—when the book first opened—had not gone away. It rested on him now like a hand placed gently but firmly between his shoulder blades, guiding without pushing.
He stepped closer.
“I was in the mine,” he said, more to himself than anything else. “There was a… a chamber. And then—this.”
His gaze flicked to the walls. The diagrams. The bones. The meticulous order of everything. This place had not been abandoned in haste. It had been left behind deliberately.
“What happened down there?” he whispered. “In the chamber.”
The page stirred.
Ink surfaced slowly, as though rising through water. No flourish. No explanation. Just a single word, written in a narrow, precise hand:
FED.
Matthis frowned.
“Fed on what?” he asked.
The word faded.
Another formed beneath it, the letters appearing one by one:
YOU WERE HUNGRY.
He felt a flash of irritation then, sharp and unexpected.
“I don’t feel hungry,” he said. “I feel—”
He stopped. Considered.
His stomach was empty. He realized that suddenly, with a distant sort of surprise. He should have been ravenous. He had worked a full shift before wandering the mine. He hadn’t eaten since morning.
And yet.
“I feel fine,” he said quietly.
The book did not contradict him.
The pages turned on their own, stopping halfway through the volume. Again, blank. Then—
FEED.
That was all.
Matthis exhaled sharply through his nose.
“That’s not an answer.”
The pressure behind his eyes intensified, not painfully, but insistently. Images rose unbidden: the miners at the end of their shifts, shoulders slumped; the way the town sagged under its own exhaustion; the cages outside the guild, rattling softly as bone knocked against bone; Elspeth’s smile, held together by effort and habit.
Emotion, thick and omnipresent, saturated the world he had come from.
The book did not explain.
It did not need to.

When he woke—if waking was the right word—he was back in his bunk.
The barracks ceiling loomed overhead, beams dark with age and soot. Someone down the row snored softly. The familiar smell of sweat, oil, and old stone grounded him in a way the chamber never had.
Matthis sat up slowly.
Morning light crept through the narrow window. His lantern sat on the floor where he always left it. His boots were neatly placed beside the bed.
The book rested against his ribs, wrapped in cloth.
His heart lurched.
He tore the fabric aside, half-expecting it to be gone.
It wasn’t.
The cover was cool beneath his fingers, utterly mundane in the thin morning light. Just a book. Just weight and leather and paper.
And yet—
He swung his legs over the side of the bunk and stood.
No dizziness. No stiffness. His muscles felt loose, ready, as though he had slept deeply.
He hadn’t.
He knew that. The night lingered in his mind, dense and unbroken by dreams. He had lain awake for hours, staring at the dark, the word FEED repeating itself until it lost meaning and became something closer to instinct.
He dressed and reported for duty.
The miners were already moving, boots scuffing stone, voices low and tired. As Matthis took his place near the carts, he became aware of something new.
Not voices.
Weight.
The air around the men felt thick, heavy with irritation, fatigue, dull resentment. It brushed against his skin like humidity before a storm. He swallowed, unsettled.
As one of the carts tipped, spilling ore, Matthis stepped forward without thinking. He grabbed the edge and heaved.
The cart righted itself easily.
Too easily.
A miner blinked at him. “Didn’t know you had that in you,” he said, half-amused. “Been eating better?”
Matthis stared at his hands.
“I—no,” he said.
Another man laughed. “Death guild feeding you special rations now?”
Matthis forced a smile and stepped back.
His pulse was steady. His breathing calm.
The weight in the air thinned, just slightly, where he stood.
He worked the entire day without slowing.
When night fell, he returned to the barracks and lay down.
Sleep did not come.
---
It took three days for him to be certain.
Three days of strength that did not fade. Three days of waking without soreness, without hunger. Three days of comments murmured behind hands—stronger, faster, what’s got into him?
He carried chains that should have dragged him down. He climbed stairs two at a time. His body obeyed him with a smoothness that felt borrowed.
And always—always—there was that awareness.
The emotions around him were no longer abstract. They pressed in, distinct and textured. Irritation had a sharp edge. Fear prickled. Desire was warm and restless, coiling low in the gut. Grief hung heavy, dampening everything it touched.
The book never spoke.
It never needed to.
On the fourth night, the hunger came.
It was not hunger for food. His stomach was quiet, uninterested. This was something else—an ache that hollowed him out from the inside, sharp and insistent. His hands shook. Sweat beaded along his spine.
He sat on his bunk, breath coming fast.
“No,” he muttered. “Not like this.”
The book lay open on his knees. He hadn’t remembered opening it.
The page was already written.
FEED.
His jaw clenched.
“On what?” he whispered again.
The letters shifted, reforming.
WHAT FLOWS.
The barracks felt suddenly crowded. Too many bodies. Too much noise. The air vibrated with irritation, exhaustion, longing.
Matthis closed his eyes.
He did not reach out.
He did not mean to.
Something inside him simply opened.
The hunger eased.
Warmth flooded him, rushing through his limbs, settling deep in his chest. His breathing slowed. The ache vanished as abruptly as it had come, leaving only a deep, bone-satisfied calm.
He sagged forward, elbows on his knees, sweat dripping from his hairline.
When he looked up, the page had changed again.
A name had appeared at the top of the sheet, written with careful reverence:
MNEMOSYNE.
The Mother of Memory.
The book that remembers.
Matthis swallowed, heart pounding—not with fear now, but with something dangerously close to awe.
“There are others,” he murmured, the realization settling into place. “Not just wizards.”
The page did not deny it.
The letters beneath the name rearranged themselves slowly, deliberately, as if savoring the moment.
MORE.
Matthis wiped his face with trembling hands and laughed softly, breathless and unsteady.
Satisfied.
And somewhere deep beneath the world, something old remembered him in return.

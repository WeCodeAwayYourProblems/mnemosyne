Name,Role,Description
Matthis,Guild Master of the Death Guild → Striga (Incubus),Sole operator and founder-in-practice of the Death Guild after the mining disaster. Former miner turned custodian of wizard dead. Responsible for containment, observation, and final destruction of undead remains. Quiet, disciplined, and deeply burdened by moral responsibility. Accidentally fed on a dying wizard and became something parasitic and unnatural. Exercises influence rather than command, fearing domination and loss of self. His authority grows through results, not proclamation.
Bartholomew,Mine-employed wizard,A seasoned earth-magic wizard retained by the mine. Wry, sharp-tongued, and fatalistic, he treats horror as routine. Assists with corpse handling and undead containment when required. Alternates between mocking and respecting Matthis, unsettled by his effectiveness and restraint.
Elspeth,Tavern cook and latent witch,Works the kitchen at the Staff and Flagon public house. Warm, perceptive, and quietly resilient. Possesses innate witchcraft that unconsciously enchants food—meals that restore strength, calm nerves, and fortify resolve. Sees through Matthis’ tension immediately and offers support without interrogation. Her presence lightens scenes and introduces hope without sentimentality.
Godric,Miner and labor foreman,A grizzled, practical miner with seniority but no formal authority. Deeply shaped by the cave-in and its aftermath. Participates in Death Guild rites out of grim necessity. Skeptical of magic yet dependent on it. Represents the working class perspective: survival first, answers optional.
Nell,Barmaid at the Staff and Flagon,A young, common barmaid marked by grief. Known for kindness and attentiveness, which drew the affection of a newly arrived wizard. Her loss provides an intimate, human cost to magical ambition and reinforces the town’s quiet desperation.
Liora,Young warlock child in crisis,A frightened child whose uncontrolled magic manifests destructively. Her condition forces Matthis to confront the ethics of intervention, restraint, and responsibility. Embodies raw, untrained power without intent or malice.
Corven,Death Guild clerk and former administrator,A minor bureaucratic holdover from before the disaster. Nervous, rule-bound, and deeply uncomfortable with Matthis’ autonomy and methods. Functions as a background voice of institutional anxiety rather than true authority.
Harlan Vetch,Mine owner and master operator,Owner and chief operator of Coalridge Pit. Shrewd, profit-driven, and exceptionally skilled at mining logistics. Cares deeply about keeping production steady and death tolls low, but has no interest in causes, metaphysics, or moral reckoning. Will fund any solution that works and asks no questions as long as the mine stays open.
